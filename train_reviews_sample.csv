I did a reservation for shereton on the fall hotel in niagra falls in canada thru them. They charged me $ 550 for two nights and promised me the room would be facing niagra fall. But the room I got didn't have any window facing niagra fall instead the window was in front of the wall from where even sun light cannot come thru.
Tried to explain everything to the receptionist but all my efforts went in vain. Tried to get hold of expedia which was of no use since the guy who did my reservation named (ketan) was sitting somewhere in India . 
My entire visit ended up in drain as I got so frustrated that I left the hotel next day. 
I wish I wouldn't have gone thru expedia. 
Just remember expedia operations are done from India so if you live in USA you cannot do anything once your credit card is charged on false promises . They'll try to lure you thru cheap prices but ultimately you'll end up losing everything because that's actually what they specialize in .
I am writing this not out of frustration but after giving a considerable thought so that others cannot be bluffed into their fraud.",5,0,0

Located just far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the Chandler Fashion Center to be relaxing, yet close enough to keep you in the action, this is that ""off the not-so beaten path"" restaurant you need to experience.

Flavorful and mouth watering food, such as, their chicken burrito (I added their green chili sauce) has kept me coming back for more. They serve breakfast burritos ALL DAY! Also offering tacos, flautas, tostadas, quesadillas, taco salads (and supra), enchiladas, chimichangas, and beers to ensure you get your money's worth.

Speaking of money, their prices are very good for the quality and portions. Friendly staff welcomes you with warm smiles as they take your order from the counter. Pick your table from the cozy inside or from the scenic patio (with bonfire pit) and after a few quick moments of enjoying the atmosphere, your food will be ready for you to devour!

I happened to see a couple great comedians here last week.

If I'm laughing at a comedy show without drinking too much, it's pretty darn funny. 

The comedians Jay Black and Gerry Bednob had me in stitches.  

The Laugh Factory itself is a great value.  3 tickets set me back about $67 with my 2-4-1 deal from The Tropicana.  There is no drink minimum and drinks were reasonably priced (2 glasses of wine and a White Russian were $28).  

The venue is quaint... so I don't see any reason to pay for VIP.  I actually got sat in VIP anyway, so I assume most people don't pay the upcharge.

I've never not enjoyed myself watching comedians at The Trop... It is a great way to spend a couple hours (and much cheaper than gambling for the same period of time)!",6,0,0

Let me start off by saying that the food at Crab Corner is not my thing. I'm not big on fried foods. At all. If you like deep fried everything (especially seafood) then, seriously, look no further. 

This place is very large.  It has lots of space, several TVs, a big bar and a great patio. The smell (seafood) is very strong when you walk in the door which kind of killed my appetite a little. The staff is great.  There was one guy, who was playing host, waiter, and bus boy.  He was doing an excellent job too - very friendly and super quick. 

We ate: 
Boardwalk Fries - Pretty tasty and very well seasoned. 
Cod - This was beer battered and fried. By far the heaviest thing we ordered. 
Catfish - ""Lightly"" breaded and fried.
Onion Rings 
Hush Puppies
Pretty much all of this tasted the same and all of it tasted like greasy breading with the exception of the Cod which had a nice vinegar finish.  I kind of dug it, but I was starting to feel really gross by the time I tasted this. 
My husband really liked the hush puppies (I thought they were kind of so so) and he also thoroughly enjoyed his soft shell crab sandwich.  

I HATE to give such a low star review and was fully prepared to 3 star this place and move on. Then, hoping to salvage the meal by treating myself to a rare something sweet, I ordered the only dessert on the menu - the snow ball.  I'm sorry but this thing was unforgivable.  If you are going to put a snow cone on your restaurant menu, it should probably be a dang good snow cone. I've had better ones served to me by 9 year olds at little league games. 

I Probably will not return.",3,0,1

My group of friends came in on a Monday night around 8PM so of course it wasn't busy. We got seated right away and our server was friendly and pretty funny. Two of my friends got a large pizza, half was chipotle and the other half was spicy Thai peanut sauce ( or something like that). I tried and thought it was very good. It was different from traditional pizzas, the hand tossed crust was to die for. Another friend of ours can't eat gluten so he got a gluten-free crust pepperoni and I, of course, had to get my greedy hand on it and it was tasty. I, myself, got an appetizer which was the Spicy Thai Peanut chicken wings. There were about 8 to 10 wings for 12 dollars, hm...a little bit pricey but was worthwhile. The flavor was different, but good. The wings were not breaded, but were crunchy.

I guess I gave a 4 star because it's a little pricey...I know it's Scottsdale, organic and everything, but for a meal and a beer, you can easily pay 40 bucks, which is, to me, not a daily thing. 

But in general, I'd recommend this restaurant. I will continue to come back.",0,0,0

We had Avicci our weekend and we all know how bad ass he is. House and Trance is what's hot now and that is what Marquee offers. It's the hottest day\/night club at the moment in Vegas which means beautiful people that comes with it. Marquee in the Cosmopolitan resort is a 60,000 square foot venue with three different rooms that plays different music but mainly electronic.  

I strongly recommend getting a table if you have a large group. We had a group of 10 dudes and got a table right inside the entrance between the main dance floor and pool area. It was a good spot where the DJ was clearly visible and also the breeze that came in from the pool area. If you don't get a table, the wait can be hours in line depending who is spinning that night. 

The place is jammed pack meaning shoulder to shoulder when the DJ comes out, which is around 1am. This is where having a table comes in handy. Waiting at the bar to gets drinks during this time is almost impossible with all the shoving and drunks. The decor is very modern with a purplish theme to it.

You may be asking yourself...""A field trip? To Cici's Pizza?""  Why yes! It's all about FRACTIONS!  This is our yearly field trip to close out our unit on fractions.  The kids pay $3.00 and they get a fairly good sized pizza (I think it's their medium) and a drink.  They also get a tour of the kitchen.  

When they finish their tour, they are allowed to build their own pizza.  They can put pepperoni's on their pizza however they would like.  They were kind enough to accommodate my student who is a vegetarian and gave her a few veggie options to choose from.  I also asked them to cut each pizza into different fractional parts...some were cut into 6, 8, or 10 pieces.  Each kiddo had to then calculate how much pizza they had eaten and other fun stuff!  

Now for the 5 stars...the staff!  They were SOOOOOOOOO friendly and were eager to share their jobs with my kids.  They encouraged them to ask questions and were just plain awesome!  My kids and I (and our parent chaperones) had an amazing time.  The pizza was delicious, as the teacher, I got to make my own...looked horrible, but tasted delicious!

A medical professional mentioned that it may be my gallbladder and prescribed me three medications that unfortunately didn't help! After having another attack, I took matters into my own hands and decided to research foods that naturally help your gallbladder and most importantly, avoid irritating it.

I found that vegetable juices like beet, cucumber, tender baby greens, swiss chard, dandelion greens, beet greens, celery, carrots, ginger, and tumeric are great for gallbladder health as well as organic grape and apple juices. Other helpful foods to add to juices: lemon, avocado, vinegar, berries, papaya, pears, and flax and hemp seeds\/oils.

Therefore, I was on a mission to find organic, cold-pressed juices that utilized these foods and hoped it would heal me! The store is very easy to find, in fact, I had seen it while driving by on Ft. Apache. Access and parking is simple as well. I love the interior! The adorable bee and honeycomb theme complete with adorable packaging, matching wall art, and the amazing table re-purposed from a tree!

The staff was so friendly, helpful, and insisted on samples. I told him which juices intrigued me and why, so I honed in on Bee WHealthy and Bee On Point. After sampling the two, I chose Bee On Point that is comprised of cucumber, celery, carrot, apple, kale, beet, dandelion, radish, lemon, ginger, turmeric, and pepper (16.9 fl. oz. for $10.99). Neither of the juices really tickled my fancy in the flavor department, however, that truly doesn't bother me nor will it stop me from future consumption because I need to minimize sugar (even natural sugar) intake as much as possible and that's typically what makes juices taste better.

Anyway, the juice was great and filled me for three hours! That was enough time for me to finish what I needed to do for the day and get home for my next meal. The great news is that after just THREE days of eating and drinking the gallbladder-helpful foods, I was able to stop the attacks! It's really wonderful having access to a place like The Juice Standard to have truly healing products when you have health issues. It was honestly the only place I trusted to have something that wouldn't trigger another attack and I was very grateful for it. Your body will heal itself if you give it the right tools. 

FYI: You receive $1 off for each glass bottle returned! But the bottles are so nice, you might want to find a purpose for them at home. Also, keep in mind that these bottles are 99.9% juice which means you're getting the good stuff, not just water or miscellaneous fillers. Yay for cold-pressed!",23,8,16

Although I was eager to go back, Liverty Village is out of the way for me so I waited until Mother's Day to bring my family over for brunch. I was surprised to find out that they didn't take reservation so we decided to go a little to gurantee us a table without having to wait too long.
When we arrived at the restaurant, there was a line forming at the door although it wasn't even open yet! I normally don't really care for brunch so I thought to myself that it must be soooooo good that people are willing to give up that extra hour of sleep on the weekend for their food.

Ordered: Scones & Biscuits 4\/5

* two for $6 or six for $14
* Baked fresh every morning
* Luscious currant scones or flakey buttermilk biscuits 
* Served with homemade preserves
* These arrived nice and warm at our table
* We decided to go with currant scones
* They were a little flakey than I expected but still very delicious
* Currants added nice fruity taste in between each bite

Ordered: The Lottie - ""It keeps me thin, Mrs. Pierce"" 3\/5

* Frisee salad with over roasted mushrooms, rosemary bacon for $12.95
* Topped with your coice of 2 eggs poached or sunny side up
* This was one of the lighter options from their brunch menu
* It was basically a salad but with eggs on top which made it 'brunch style'
* I wasn't a big fan of this dish but my family enjoyed it

Ordered: Veda's Choice 5\/5

* Mildred's classic poached eggs on a flakey croissant for $14.50
* Choice of smoked salmon or rosemary bacon topped with Bearnaise sauce and served with mixed greens
* This is one of the popular brunch dishes at Mildred's Temple Kitchen
* I went with smoked salmon and I loved it
* It is quite heavy given that it is served on buttery croissant
* I would get this again but maybe share it with someone else

Ordered: Mrs. Biederhof's Legendary Light & Fluffy Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes

* Served with Lanark county maple syrup and whipped cream for $14
* Honestly I am not a big fan of pancakes although I do crave them time to time
* These were very fluffy and light, perfect with whipped cream and fresh blueberry
* Since it was a 'lighter' pancake, it felt more like dessert than a meal
* Nonetheless, very good pancakes and I would recommend them

Summary: Overall I really enjoyed brunch at Mildred's Temple- I just can't get over their restaurant and the way it's laid out. I don't know if I would want to wake up early and line up to get in for the brunch, but I will def be back for lunch or dinner!",2,0,0

If you're not comfortable with extreme levels of spice, and I mean VERY comfortable, then this is not the place for you. If you still think you can handle it, then by all means, go ahead and try, but I've warned you!

Yupdduk is a Korean restaurant in North York that recently opened in the Yonge\/Finch area. They serve only a few dishes so far. It is a chain restaurant and there are a couple of locations in the U.S., including in New York and L.A.

I wanted to try this restaurant because it was new in the neighbourhood and I watched a YouTube video about this restaurant prior to trying it out. I generally like spicy food and I knew what I was getting into so there was a part of me that thought I could handle it. Boy, was I wrong! 

I'm giving this a 2-star in consideration of everything about this place, including environment, service and food.  This place is still fairly new so it's somewhat clean; however, the chairs and tables have splatters of sauce, so I can see this place getting run down pretty quickly.  

The service there isn't great. I mean, when you ask for help, they'll come to you, but often you have to wave them down or walk up to the cash register.  Also, considering that they serve such spicy food, they could at least give a better warning or ask if we've been there before. We also had to go up in person with the water jug asking for more water. The waiters don't really check up on you to see how you're doing, and it's confusing regarding how to pay, so we ended up paying at the cash register. The good thing about this place is that they do provide several boxes of tissues lined up along their counter for you to take! We kept a box at our table.

We ordered the popular dish for two of us, which included a huge bowl of spicy sauce with vienna sausage, fish cakes, rice cakes, cabbage, and topped with mozzarella cheese. I think I ate maybe one of each of the above because the spice was just...that...deadly (to me at least). 

I don't see what the hype is about this place though. Yes, the flavours are decent, but it is essentially the same as any Korean spicy dish at other restaurants, except that it is 100x spicier. I feel like this place would do much better if the spice wasn't so extreme. It's hard to enjoy a dish when you're struggling with each bite. I will not be returning here.

Oh, and the waitress did say that they could make it less spicy, but even the ""less spicy"" was deadly. I don't even want to imagine what the regular spice is like! We even took home more than half of the dish and tried to water is down to make it less spicy, but that didn't work either.",2,1,1

Great ambiance.  Fun staff.  Reasonable prices.  Decent wine list.  Oh, what?  You ask about the food?  Damned good, I say.  Of course, burgers call for zinfandel, so that's my pairing.  The boigas are fat, plump, juicy and flavorful.  For my preference, they're a bit over cooked, but hell I like my meat still kickin' (somewhere between steak tartar and rare).  The wine list is good; however, with the name ""zin"", one would expect a (far more) robust wine list, particularly one that pairs to the foods.  That's the only real weakness here.

- Easy to get to with a short walk from subway or streetcar routes, and busses that go right up Dufferin.
- Weekday market! That's open after 5pm! Good stuff.
- Crazy produce i'd not seen at other farmer's markets (romanesco, black kale, golden beets!)
- Baked goods aplenty
- Lots of locally sourced\/made products (wish i'd had reason to stock up at the jam\/chutney stall, for instance)

* Cons
- Not a lot of seating about the market itself if you want to enjoy some of the wares right away
- A little bottlenecking in a couple of areas due to people waiting at stalls
- For me it's a bit out of the way, but would be worth it every so often.

Can't really complain. What a terrific little market with a great range of goods. I really gotta get back there again soon.",3,0,2

But hipsters gotta eat too. Stopped in because I was hangry and allergic to my husbands parents cats and needed to kill time while he said goodbye to them (his parents not the cats) before we hit the road. Yelped this place up and per usual you didnt steer me wrong. Ordered the mac & cheese everyone raves about and its def a 5 out of 5.

 I had leftovers that my husband devoured. He said it was the best macaroni he's ever tasted. After I got out of my feelings, I had to agree. He could have at least said mine was the best (mac and cheese is very labor intensive but I have made it for him many times) and Luckys is a close second but whatevs. It truly is good good stuff. Very rich and decadent. They serve it with cold applesauce and fresh grapes. Normally I'm not a fan of mixing sweet and savory; I like my foods seperate but equal when I consume them but the waitress was so thorough and personable in her explanation of how to use the applesauce to cool down the pasta (it comes out piping hot) that I tried it. And tried it again. And again. And I couldnt stop dipping. 

What to know. Quarters are TIGHT there is not a lot of waitspace.  I felt like I was in the way no matter how much I tried to twist and turn to not be in the way. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. They quoted me an hour wait time but I was probably seated in about a half hour. All the tables turned over pretty quickly. 

If I lived in Cleveland I'd be back for sure. 

Oh, so I also had the dark chocolate cake with salted something or another with buttercream frosting. No bueno. The cake itself was dense and dry and the icing tasted like straight butter and salt with not enough sugar... def not the special sweet treat I had hoped for. My hopes were high because the description sorta kinda if you're reaching reminded me of the old school late nineties\/ early two thousands Olive Garden dessert, Chocolate Lasagna that was discontinued.

Service:
It went from bad to worst. We had the ""audacity"" to ask for lunch specials (with $15-$20 for personal pizzas and $18-$24 for pastas you kind of look for a value). 
The server (one of the owners?) gave us a measuring look, half-turned to walk away and throw some words over his shoulder that none of us caught. They don't have the specials printed anywhere. 

The boys running around with water have very limited English. 

It took whooping 45 minutes for our food to arrive. 

When two of us asked to have the pizzas to go (in hopes to salvage it later with cheese and fresh herbs), they've folded the slices of pizza one on top of the other (even though it was half tomato, half white source) and wrapped it in aluminium paper. It was all smooched together and had to be thrown to trash later. When we've confronted the server (owner?), he instantly got rude and aggressive, saying staff like ""everyone in this country is asking for pizzas to go, its too expensive to have boxes"" and something rather unflattering in Italian. 

Food:
That was the main insult. The pizzas are awful! I don't exaggerate: we had ordered 4 different pizzas and all were half-baked, with cold pieces of cheese and tomato souse out of the box. The middle of the pizza was soggy, greasy and downright disgusting. As for the authenticity of the whole experience, everyone at our table have been to Italy at least once, with two guys born and raised in Italy, and all have confirmed that this miserable excuse for a pizza has nothing to do with Italy. 
Pastas fared a bit better, but the ""seafood"" was one shrimp cut into smallest pieces imaginable and pasta with basil had no fresh basil on it. For $23.99, the linguine alone was not worth it. 

Verdict: 
With so many other choices (including good Italian places), why would you subject yourself to this awful food and bad service? Dine somewhere else.",4,1,0

It's so bad there that if I had a choice, I would have given ZERO stars.  To summarize this place, it's in the ghetto and it is ghetto.  The residents that live in the apartment complex are ghetto.  Residents seem to not care that other people live around and make noise at all times of the day.  Residents try to claim parking stalls that are vacant, but when assigned, they still continue to park in your stall.  The speed bumps are really annoying and bad for your vehicles.  This place is GHETTO.

Read on if you want details of how ridiculous this place is:

I moved here because the price was decent and at the time I could only afford what they were offering.  The moving in process was fine.  I toured apartments with Chelsea who was the ONLY PERSON I would choose to speak to since everyone else were rude and lacked customer service skills.

Within 2 months of living there a couple moved into the apartment next to me.  A couple weeks later, I come home to a bullet hole in my living room wall.  The bullet launched into my apartment and landed itself into ground between my rug and the cement under the rug.  I called the police and filed a report.  My neighbor's friend was apparently ""CLEANING"" the gun and it accidentally went off.  He managed to clip his hand and miss my 2 dogs who were in their kennel by less than a foot.

As outraged as I was, there was no charges pressed against my neighbors since they had a clean record.  BULLSHIT.  As months go on, Metro Police seems to be visiting my neighbors for domestics.  I never called the police  on them so I'm not sure who did or why they were actually there.  All I know is if there are 3 police cars surrounding the front of your apartment building, it's kinda serious right?

I set up a meeting with the resident\/property manager the following day.  She simply brushed off the incident as if it happened all the time.  She said she has close contact with Metro Police and this ""type of incident"" happens more often than everyone thinks.  THATS NOT THE FUCKEN POINT.  The point is what if I was home?  What if I was shot?  What boggled my mind was that she had no clue that this had happened even thought she claims to have close contact with Metro Police.  Jennifer Greene is a bullshit liar who is a sorry ass excuse for a resident\/property manager.

Now that I moved out, I'm much happier to be away from this SH!T hole.  I recently called to see if they could check my mail box for any remaining mail that may have been sent to my old address, I had submitted a change of address a while ago, but just wanted to check with them incase anything slipped through the post office. Mike in the office said no.  I asked for the resident\/property manager and he said she is not available.  He started to use a aggressive tone with me about the process how they change the locks on the apartments and mailboxes.  Honestly I wasn't calling for the lock changing process.  I just want my f*cken mail.",13,9,2

I saw the sign facing the 215 for weeks.  Drove by one day only to find out it wasn't open for business yet.  As the weeks went by, I stared longing at that sign EVERY damned day, wondering when the hell I was going to get my chance.

Then, by chance, my wife decided she would get me some sugar and they were open!  She came home with a really nice bag that contained these attractive pink boxes with clear cellophane lids (presumably to see the contents, eh?).  Unfortunately for my review, she's not very detail oriented, so I can't really tell you the exact names of what she bought, nor can I even describe the store and what other goods they offer.   Here's what we ended up with, according to her recollection:

1.  Cake pops: They were chocolate cake with a chocolate shell.  Besides my not understanding the whole cupcake fad (is it really going to last?), I have hated - no really HATED - the whole cake pop thing.  All the ones I've had were either tasteless, dry, way too dense or a combination thereof.  These, however, were the anti-thesis to all that I have hated (HATED) about cake pops.  These were rich, moist and cake-like (as opposed to tasting like they mixed a pound of frosting with some leftover crumbs to hold it all together).  The only thing I hated (HATED) about these particular cake pops is that they were too doggone small.  One bite.  That's all it took.  :(

1.  Red Velvet cupcakes: ok, so it didn't take a genius to know what this one was.  These were tasty, but not as moist or rich as the red velvet I know and love.  Ok substitute, but not enough to make me crave them.

2.  Peanut butter cupcake: I'm not really a fan of peanut butter pastries, so I didn't even take a bite.  She liked them, but she was short on adjectives, so I can't really elaborate.

3.  Bacon Banana cupcake: un-holy-freaking-rock-my-sugar-tooth-believable.  If you know me, you know I'm a bacon addict.  This cupcake was a revelation, a total mouth f***.  But let me back up and start at the beginning.  Once upon a time, there was this little confection that didn't smell all that enticing.  Had it not been for the bacon chunks on the frosting, I would have skipped it.  The scent was a bit confusing, starting with overt rendered bacon fat tones and an undercurrent of burnt sugar.  Not the most appetizing combo in all honestly.  Anyway, after cutting it in two, only then could I smell banana, which really threw my nose for a loop.  Then I took a bite.  I can't say it was heaven, nor that it was the best thing I have eaten in my life.  What I can and will say is that the flavor combination just works.  The sweet of the frosting and salty of the bacon are harmonious, with the tropical banana adding a whole new dimension.  

I love inventive dishes that a cook\/chef prepares that tries to let you in on a secret.  Sometimes you're just not meant to understand that secret and other times, when you get it, it totally makes you respect the thought and effort behind the creation.  The bacon banana cupcake really sealed the deal for me.  I'll be back to try some other unique creations.  Whatever they're baking, gimme some sugar baby.",10,11,8

On y retrouvera donc surtout des familles vivant aux alentours, ou bien des courageux qui auront suivi la piste cyclable du canal Lachine. Ou encore des gens qui ont la chance d'avoir une auto.
Sur place, vous pourrez faire un barbecue, profiter des rives du lac Saint Louis ou encore des 22 sculptures amnages ici parmi les arbres. (L'ide premire du parc tait d'en faire une sorte d'exposition de plein air)
Calme et nature garanti!
Ct pratique : il y a un parking (payant)  l'entre du parc.
Vous trouverez des commodits (gratuites) tout au bout de la jete.
Vous pourrez mme vous tremper les pieds, toujours au bout de la jete, mais attention aux grosses pierres sur lesquels les enfants peuvent se blesser.",2,0,2

I've had:  the petite filet (tasty, moist, tender), baked potato (GIGANTIC, buttery, salty, exquisite), broccoli (about as good as steamed broccoli could be, HUGE pieces), butternut squash soup (to die for), caesar salad (crisp, perfect amount of dressing and cheese, crunchy croutons), and chocolate lava cake (orgasmic).  

My friends had:  shrimp cocktail, surf and turf, cowboy cut steak (i think that's what it's called, all i know is it's EXPENSIVE), oysters, and they all said it was the most delicious food they've ever eaten.

So when it went pop last night and smoke rolled out, I knew I needed an expert to tell me if it could be repaired or if I was looking at a replacement.

I called right after they openned and from the start of the phone call, I knew I was in good hands. Matthew answered my questions and told me what to bring with me. His directions for finding their location were also excellent.

Vince started in on my computer as soon as it arrived. I appreciated his thoroughness and attention to detail. Within 10 minutes, he diagnosed the problem and I knew it was a repair and not a replacement. With a 5 year old machine, finding the right parts and connections took a little effort, but he did it.

I waited while they resolved my problem. This also gave me the chance to observe other customers and their interactions. Overall, everyone left happy and they were treated with respect.

These guys could have charged me an arm and a leg, but my bill was only the cost of the part and a half hour of labor. They didn't gouge me for diagnostics or make me pay for services I didn't need. 

They did recommend a maintenance service for me, and based on my great experience today, I will schedule that with them.

To start the story off this company towed me from my own parking spot in my own apartment complex (which I pay for) because they thought my tags had expired. I went to the office to correct the situation and they were extremely rude, even repeatedly called me a ""LIAR"", because they did not believe I had up-to date registration on my vehicle. After dealing with their rude employees, I returned to the property not 10 minutes later with my proof of registration (including a printed date on the paper of February 2014 which is well before the current date) thinking they would be somewhat apologetic, however to my dismay they CONTINUED to call me a Liar... 

To make matters even worse, the OWNER of the entire property came out and said, ""Is it true your calling him a liar"", and manager just shrugged her shoulders and said yes like it was no big deal. I thought the owner would hopefully correct her and demand better service but he just walked out of the trailer without even questioning it. The only way I was even able to get my car out of the lot was by having my property manger DEMAND it be released or they would go to the police for contract infringement

Toby is a 2 year old Terrier- Poodle mix, he is extremely friendly and loving but also very stubborn and did not always want to listen. He wouldn't sit on command and most definitely wouldn't stay! He also had trouble when we would go out on walks, he would take off running after birds and rabbits, and pulling on his leash. After months of frustration, my husband and I decided it was time to take him to a trainer. We did extensive research for trainers all over the Valley- private, group, chain stores and the one thing that stuck out was that All- American had the best reviews. At first, I was skeptical of the E-Collar. I did not want Toby's loving personality to change and I did not want to hurt him or for Toby to be scared of us. On the first day of training we met with Bob, he explained the collar, how he trains, and we were able to feel the different settings of the collar-  and I was able to see that it did not hurt me and wouldn't hurt my dog. It was reassuring to me to know that it was more of a ""nudge"" and when used with training it starts at the lowest setting that the dog responds to. Each class focused on a new command and it didn't take long for Toby to learn how to ""heel"" and walk pleasantly next to us. Fast forward to four weeks later and Toby is still happy as can be but now he listens! When it is time to put his collar on- he knows this means going for a walk or a car ride and working on his training and he gets excited- tail wagging n all. He didn't lose his personality, but he gained control. We can now walk off leash, he follows commands- heel, sit, stay and will even stay put when we walk away from him! His anxiety levels have even gone down. I highly recommend Bob as a trainer. He teaches you how to work with your dog one-on-one, so that the training sticks. We are so happy that we found All-American K-9 Dog Training!!",0,0,0

This place has been my first and last option on many occasions when I was just too lazy to get on the subway, or too fearful of dealing with the B.O. and life threatening experience that we call a cab ride in Toronto. 

The $10 cover is average. It makes it easier to swallow since there is almost never a line-up when I do go. The dress code is enforced randomly, although on most nights I just wear sneakers and never have a problem. The best part about this place is the live band on Saturday nights. They really get the crowd in the mood and they play old school R&B and hip-hop regularly. 

The drinks are on the pricey side and it can get VERY crowded sometimes. They don't offer bottle service for some reason. It can take a LONG time to order drinks from the bar. I've seen a bartender throw a tip (not mine) away because he considered it ""cheap"". I thought it was pretty rude. They're not the friendliest bunch in my experience. 

Despite the $10 cover and expensive drinks, I'll still keep coming back. The routine has been to get drunk at Alleycatz, go to Mars for some corned beef hash, stagger home, and pass out. You can't put a price on that!",0,2,0

The parking lot was very full when I got there.  To the point that cars were parked on the grass, along the street, and at the neighboring hotel.  Be patient as you search for a spot or plan for a bit of a walk to the door.

I was the last one to arrive.  The group ordered nachos to stem the tide.  Word was the nachos were good and easy to share.  Most of us ordered a fish dinner.  My brother ordered the Italian steak sandwich.  It was a generous sandwich with peppers and onions.   My cousin on the other end ot the table had a sandwich also but I couldn't  tell what he had.

I had the Walleye dinner.  Fried filets of tender Walleye.  Served with coleslaw, choice of potato,  and the fixings for the Fish  (lemon wedge, tartar sauce).  I enjoyed my fish with a baked potato.   Several guests ordered mixed vegetables instead of a starchy potato and a baked cod.

Our server did pretty well with our large group.   He did mix plate locations but he checked with us a good amount of time.  He handled the bill split relatively well but handed the wrong bill to the wrong person.   He had a nice smile so easily to forgive.  It was a good night",0,0,1

It was a good bagel and the strawberry cream cheese was homemade which was unique and delicious. I'd never heard of a bialy which is similar to a bagel except it's not boiled like a bagel,  doesn't have a hole,  and is slimmer. I didn't care for the taste or texture of the bialy.

I went to several different orthodontists before I tried Kimodontics. They were all very disappointing. They didn't care about me and were only interested in making money. One orthodontist sent me to a periodontist for a treatment before anything which I later found out wasn't as necessary. (They must take commission!) Long story short, I almost gave up my dream of having beautiful, straight teeth, then I heard about Kimodontics. With all the concerns and doubts from my bad experiences with other orthodontists, I decided to check it out. WOW! I wish I had known Dr. Kim's existence earlier!  The moment I walked in, I already felt welcomed and comfortable. Dr. Kim was very sweet and yet professional giving me a thorough explanations on what to expect and I was already at ease that I can count on her for the treatment. Dr. Kim is an absolute sweetheart and so are the rest of the staff!  Dr. Kim takes responsibility in making sure my invisalign is to my satisfaction.

As mentioned, this particular Giant Eagle contains a Liquor Store.  I'm not a big drinker, but it is very nice to be able to purchase a full liquor supply here if needed.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  The deli in this particular Giant Eagle is a hell-hole.  During my last visit to this location, I walked up to the deli counter at 8:34 pm.  The very large woman behind the counter was just standing there, yukking it up with her coworker.  
 
After a little time had passed - you know, so she could laugh more - she finally decided to ask what I needed.  I told her and she then informed me that they would not cut any more meat for the evening; the reason being, they were closing down and cleaning up.

I asked her what time they closed the deli and she said 9:00 pm.  Yes, they still had 26 minutes till they closed, but she was flat-out refusing to cut anything else.  And I'm not paranoid, and very, very rarely call anybody on racism, but there was a definite edge to her refusal of my request.

After paying for my order, I went to the service desk and complained.  The woman behind the counter said, ""Ugh.  Again?  Yeah, people have complained about that a bunch of times before.  I'll get the manager.""  When the manager showed up, he took my complaint and noted that they are supposed to cut meat all the way until 8:55 pm.  He said he would talk to the woman that treated me rudely at the deli.  I knew he wouldn't.  He was young and tiny and she would eat him alive if he dared utter a word.

In addition to the deli experience, I'd have to say that customer service throughout this Giant Eagle is sorely lacking.  The place also doesn't seem as clean as the other stores in the chain.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  I like shopping at Giant Eagle, but will never return to this location unless I am hankering to be abused by Jabba the Hutt at the deli counter.",6,8,1

but I had a very bad experience at Tipsy Cow. I went on a Monday night for dinner.

It's seat yourself, but there was no way to know it until one of the servers walking by told us to seat ourselves. The other group waiting who came after us then took the table we would've wanted so we lucked out there.

It took a while for our server to find us and bring us menus, one of which was a beer menu written on a piece of receipt paper... While we were waiting to place our order, we saw a group of people leave without ordering and left their menus on their table - bad sign. There were only 2 servers working there that night, so I understand why we didn't see our server much. But the lack of service we received when she came by and her unfriendliness was very discouraging. We ordered burgers, which arrived way over cooked. We asked for refills of water but never got them. Our server would visit the table next to us but would ignore us, and not once did she even ask how things were. We eventually had to go up to the bar to get waters. Oh but when we went up to the bar, the bartender had disappeared for a few minutes too. At last, we saw our waitress who already had our check and silently left it on the table. We noticed that she at least had the time to write ""thank you"" on the check. She again visited the table next to us but conveniently didn't notice our check was ready to be picked up so I had to get up and follow her to hand it to her.

I was definitely not impressed by the venue or the food. The service could have made up for it, but unfortunately it was severely lacking.",2,0,0

Food: 
- Cracked pepper butter was delicious - I had to warn the waitress not to let me have any more bread and ruin my meal!
- Grilled Bruschetta (ricotta, fava beans, Swiss chard,  preserved lemon, arugula, chervil, Calcagno) was a bit too lemon-y for my liking
- Short Rib Raviolli (Short Rib Ravioli, Swiss chard, oyster mushrooms, roasted shallots, gremolata) was very savory and I would definitely order it again
- Double-Cut Pork Chop (with braised kale, prosciutto & parmesan risotto, garlic cream, sage jus) was Joe's meal. I tasted a bit of everything and really enjoyed the kale. I like really really creamy risotto, and this wasn't quite there. I dont want to say it was undercooked, as I like I just like mine over-cooked.
- Fried Apple Empanadas (vanilla bean cider reduction, toasted oat streusel,  
caramel ice cream) The ice cream was great, but the empanadas were bland to me.

Service: Not terrible. I understand at nice restaurants people enjoy taking their time to relax, enjoy their meals, and converse with their dinner-mates, but our server should have been more observant to the fact that we would be just sitting there with empty places waiting for the desert menu. I will note, though, that the table next to us returned two glasses of the same wine and the bartender came over and very politely suggested an alternative wine for the patron.

For quality of the pho, I would rate them around 3.5 stars since the stock is a bit on the sweeter side and not as complex but a step above msg stock from a packet of powder, and there does appear to be a markup of $1-2 from similar entrees in Chinatown.  I completely agree with other reviews regarding their Bun Bo Hue since it's a bit toned down for less adventurous palates (not inherently spicy, but using their housemade chili sauce really elevates the dish) and there is a lack of the blood-cake and random pork parts (pork hock included only by request) that make this dish unique. 

I know that some folks may make a general rating based on traditional items such as pho and banh mi, but I think the true gems on this menu lie a little off the beaten path.  The shrimp paste spring rolls are tightly wrapped like cuban cigars and have a nice ratio of meat and vermicelli\/vegetables with the rice skin having a nice toothsome texture.  They also have some other intriguing items in the appetizer section such as a deep fried savory vietnamese crepe, carpaccio salad, and other items that I am excited to try.  One dish in particular was recommended by the manager on my most recent visit : the shrimp and crab udon soup (banh canh cua).   

I was a bit skeptical since I expected some half Vietnamese\/Japanese concoction with imitation crab and overcooked shrimp in a bland clear broth, but what arrived was an unexpected deluge of flavor that blew me away!    The broth is thick and  starchy like a good hot and sour soup with bits of real crab meat bathing unctuous udon noodles made with tapioca flour (not to be confused with the Japanese variety) that had a hybrid texture between italian bucatini and Korean dukbokki.  The manager strongly recommended adding a generous sprinkle of black pepper and I wanted to increase the heat with a dollop of the chili paste so I applied both.  I'm usually a fairly adventurous eater that likes to constantly try new things on a menu, but this was one of those dishes where I seriously contemplated never ordering anything else again because I didn't want to deal with the regret of ordering an inferior dish.  The noodles\/broth ratio was great since I still had noodles down to my last bite and the thick broth is perfect to coat the udon with layers of umami since the noodle isn't capable of absorbing much flavor.  The only weak spot was the shrimp since they were indeed a tad overcooked and lacked the sweetness and snap of the recently caught variety.  Definitely earns a spot amongst my top 10 vietnamese soups in Las Vegas.",11,3,11

QWxwhi6CCU_DzVvXd_Y3WA,3hh64fNta-CJGDE2zkEFNA,8qnPy-4QV1VGkoeu2LGa9g,1,2017-04-19,"One star because only 1 good nurse named Jillian in ICU did her very best to make my mom's 10 day. Jillian did her best to request my mom's room, but unfortunately 2 times was she able too. However, even when she wasn't assigned to take care of my mom- she would always come in & say hi to her\/us. Always made sure we were okay & made small talk with us, which felt really nice. Thank you Jillian. 

My mother went to the ER about a month ago, stating to the doctor (Asian with tattoos on his arm) that she was having fevers for the past 3-4 months, the doctor responded back to her saying that it was unrealistic for a person to have to go through all of that. So he prescribed her medication (a high dosage of ibuprofen) & was let go. 

Just recently my mother went back in for the same symptoms, a swollen lymph node by her ear & swollen feet. I went with her to help seek urgent attention. She was immediately taken in & several tests were done when she went in back. We waited about 2 almost 3 hours for the same doctor to come in & ask her what seemed liked an annoying tone of voice, ""what has brought you back in?"". I jumped in to help my mom & told him the same symptoms she originally had told him a few weeks back in addition to slurred words & disorientation. He looked back towards her results & stated her liver was abnormal, she may have hepatitis. I asked him if this is what he's diagnosing & he said it's what she may have. Which didn't make sense to us because it was an unclear diagnosis that he was making. He admitted her in.

My mom went into level 4 where it's known for ""not so serious"" (per a CNA) level of care. My mom went on to having fever up to 104 for more than 2 hours where she became confused, not recognizing  who I was. I would call the nurses in, & it would literally take them more than 15 minutes to come in. That was our first night. They had my mom ""NPO"" that whole night & the following morning because she was scheduled for testing at 1:30pm. My mom was very weak come that morning, so when she needed to go use the restroom she needed help from me. I called in a nurse to help me walk her to the restroom & again no one showed to help- I did my very best to use all the strength in my body to pull my mom off the bed & walk her but she did not make it, & had an accident all over the floor. I managed to clean her, clean the floor, lay her down & wait another 10 minutes for a nurse to finally come in. That nurse tried to pull my mom back up, & I asked confusingly what she was trying to do & she responded with, I'm going to take her to the restroom. WTF?! I lost my shit! She just did, 30 minutes ago!That night my mom went through another struggle of fever that eventually 6 nurses walked in & rushed her to ICU.

In ICU, it's the same thing. Nurses don't come in on time, she had many times where she had accidents going to pee or when walking to use the toilet  because the nurses would not come in on time to help me. When her fever would go up, I would call the nurse for ice packs, & it wouldn't be given to me until after 20 minutes of me calling. If anything the nurse should've helped me bring down her fever, but every time I would ask for help they would seem annoyed. She had different nurses everyday. The assistant nurses would sometimes help more than the actual nurse. 

When asking for other ""nurses"" help, that weren't assigned to her they would become very rude\/angry with one. We had 2 incidents where we were responded ""I'm not her nurse!"" Well where is her nurse? ""She just past you!"". Another ""I'm not her nurse!"" ""I don't know what's going on!"". If you went to the center of the computer area, their was food everywhere & girls always focused on charting. Charge nurses would come in to check on us, but if we tried to suggest\/complain they would blow us off. It was very uncomfortable. These patients are already going through a really hard time. More smiles, more attention, more care should be added to these employees daily work routine. You guys went to school for this, you chose to work in this field, don't be upset or angry with these sick patients or worried family members- it was so upsetting to deal with all of this.

Dr. Ellis was the doctor taking care of my mother. He would show once every other day. For 9 days we had no results given to us. He would say the same thing to us, as far as results we're still reviewing her testing. My mom had more than 4 CT scans, more than 4 ultrasounds, I can't even tell you the amount of blood taken out, X-RAYS, stomach scan & a biopsy! We were so impatient to not receive any idea of what she may have. When Dr. Ellis would tell us what she may have, it was always a ""maybe"" he couldn't confirm it to us because there was not an actual specialist to see the tests he was seeing. He later said she may have Hodgkin Lymphoma Disease & discharged us? Told us to make an appt with an oncologist. He always seemed annoyed when talking & didn't seem to care. So upsetting",1,0,1

There aren't many other stores where you can walk around and see beautifully-taxidermied wildlife staring at you from appropriate scenery. The store itself is impressive, too, with products as far as the eye can see and some nice lodgey architecture. Oh, right, and the gun gallery has some beautiful guns the price of the car you drove to get there.

As far as a place to actually shop, though, it's a little more hit or miss. Their camping selection is mediocre and their tent selection is abysmal. Archers are better served with local archery shops and shooters are better served with local gun shops. Cargo management is basically non-existent. (So when Cabela's argued the store wouldn't impact local businesses a whole lot... They were right.)

If you need CLOTHING, on the other hand... Now we're talking. Whatever you need, Cabela's has got it in spades. Shorts, shirts, waders, camo, pants, balaclavas, socks, thermal underwear, and more! If you can't find the outdoor wear you're looking for, you're either not trying or you require freak sizes like me. And Cabela's does have some stuff in sizes that suit the tall crowd--just not a lot.

Go, enjoy the sights, and maybe buy some clothes for your next adventure. Just don't go there expecting amazing prices or to check everything off your outdoor shopping list.",3,0,0

We had high hopes and expectations but that just didn't materialize.  The beautiful decor is that of the previous restaurants in the space, namely Earnest and Cork, respectively.  We don't drink wine, so we can only comment on the food.  We started with a bruschetta board, which was quite good.  My wife had the pork which was drowned in sauce while I had the rib-eye, which was the thinnest rib-eye I have ever been served anywhere...and tasteless even with the butter topping.  The potatoes on both plates were also quite good but our rating is based on our disappointment with the meat portion of our entrees.

Reading the background of the new owners, we expected classically prepared French dinners but that wasn't the case.  At the price points they're charging, they're going to have to inventory and sell a lot of wine to make a go of it in what has become a poor location for all restaurants and retail businesses.

Egg was cooked perfectly with that gooey runny yolk. Also ordered some appetizers. The spicy karage had a nice kick to it. Meat was juicy with a nice crispy exterior. The dumplings were decent.

I'm a fairly unadventurous eater. Once I find my favorite, I like to stick to it, but that's pretty much impossible here. I want to try everything, and think that over time, I'll eventually get there. Until then, my top recommendations are the street plate with at least 1 mole taco. You'll be upcharged, but if that's your only reason for not trying this piece of delicious, message me for a stronger sales pitch. The point of this place is that if you know what you like, or even if you don't, you'll find something here.

Most people either hate or love this restaurant. I love it. I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal here. 

My go to order is the beef pho with rare steak $7.75.
I pile my steaming bowl high with Thai basil, fresh squeezed lime, and only two jalapeo rings (any more and it gets too spicy towards the end).

You can add extra meat or extra noodles for only $1.00, but I can never eat that much. I usually don't finish my broth and then take it to go and boil noodles for a redo the next day! Score. double meals. 

I've tried a lot of the menu and some of my favorites include:
the chicken wings covered in Pho Kim Long sauce;
the walnut-mayonnaise shrimp; and 
Oh so tender Calamari.

I'll admit it, the boyfriend and I are snobs and we usually steer clear of buffets. This past weekend we were staying at the Encore, it was a Sunday morning, two friends joined us for brunch and as we were walking around the resort we walked right into the buffet. We were just about to walk away from it when we got a bit curious and decided to check it out. 

The line was ridiculous! It was Sunday brunch so I think the price was $32 a person. We didn't want to wait in line, so we paid the extra $15 a person for the VIP pass. $15 includes, line cuts to the front, and a free drink, your choice of sangria, wine or a mimosa. Not a bad deal since the hosts in the front told us that the line was 45 mins to an hour long. No thanks!

The buffet was amazing! As we were being walked to our seats we were oooing and ahhing at all the desserts and the large amount of food selection. They were prompt with the alcoholic drinks and we went on our way through the food. The selections seemed endless so half of us just walked to the end just so we could see everything to mentally prep our stomachs. 

There was an omelets station, prime rib and fatty bacon cutting station, fresh sushi, fresh shrimp, tons of pasta selections, everything breakfast related, fresh fruit and baked goods, Mexican cuisine, Asian cuisine etc. Lets just say everything was there!

The highlights: Fatty bacon was delicious with their special mustard. The shrimp wasn't your typical baby cocktail shrimp, definitely huge fatty juicy shrimp with cocktail sauce, cups of marinated watermelon and pineapple (the pineapple was marinated in rum and coconut flakes)

Everything we ate was delicious, by the time we got to desserts we were stuffed. We tried a few cakes (all yummy) and their gellato! Yes you heard right, they had many flavors of gellato for you to choose from. I would definitely advise not to fill up on the bread (although delicious) definitely fills you up so you can't eat all the other amazing food there.

Aside from the food, the service was amazing as well. Empty plates and cups were always cleared promptly from our table.",5,3,1

The set up and the decor all suggested my initial thoughts.  After glancing over the menu I decided my decision was conclusive.  We decided to sit outside because let's face it one of the pros of living in Phoenix is that you can have lunch outside in January.  It was a beautiful day.

   My counter part ordered the Reuben sandwich, which actually looked pretty darn tasty.  I ordered the Windsor burger, topped with caramelized onions and cheese.  Even though my burger was overdone to my request of rare I still ate it anyways because 1. I don't like to waste food, and 2. it was still pretty darn tasty.  The french fries could definitely use improvement though.  They were just blah.

The sales staff that we worked with were very knowledgeable and above all always treated us fairly and honestly. Our contacts were Josh, Jake, and Joe; they were all great. We did a lot of preliminary research into the model we wanted and in trying to establish what a fair price was for the car. We also had a very good idea regarding the trade in value of our old Mazda. The fact that it had only been serviced by Camelback Mazda made valuing it easier for them. We were well aware that, in general, people often have negative car buying experiences; but we were well prepared. We knew the car, prices, mark-ups, availability of special financing, what add-ons we wanted and didn't want. We did our homework and we were ready to walk if we couldn't negotiate a fair deal.  We made it a point to engage in conversation with as many of the staff as possible and that seemed to communicate to the salesperson and his managers that we were serious and resolved to get a fair deal.

The equipment all worked well and was easy to use and understand for rookies. 
It was indoors but did get somewhat warm with running around, diving behind barriers and shooting.
It is a lot of fun and is very realistic. It definitely hurts getting hit and will leave bruises welts etc.
Wear long pants (sweat pants) and a hoody for protection.
My only word of caution is to play only with your group if you are first timers.
There were 5 or 6 dudes who obviously played regularly and they dominated the games they played against my 10 year olds. You can easily spot these guys because they have top notch gear and shoot faster and more accurately than anyone else.
Don't play w these guys unless you want to be dominated!!!!!!
Just stick with your own players.
The safety rules are important and necessary. 
Overall great place great value and great fun",0,0,0

Absolutely stunning food and impeccable service. We were 9 of us including 2 vegetarians. We all shared the food and I have to say, everything was fresh and full of flavor. So many dishes that I can't describe.

Service too was very slick. Our glasses of water were never empty in spite of the restaurant being full. When appetizer plates were taken away, so were the used silverware. A friend and I never used our knife. Only our fork and spoon. Those were taken. When fresh plates were brought, the server brought a fresh fork and spoon for me and the other friend. Attention to detail.

Definitely going to be a place to visit each time I come to Montreal.",6,0,0

I will go back and I am not a senior citizen, I didn't think they served Mexican and I am accustomed to paying $25 a plate, so the prices did not cause me to implode. So, for all the reviews that came before me...I rebuke you. 

I found the food really well prepared, the wine list is good, not exceptional, the service is exceptional. 

My husband and I went on a Tuesday evening and were seated right away. The decor is a bit 80's, with peachy\/mauve walls and numerous tables w\/white tablecloths and buffet chairs. But the dining area is large and you can feel secluded but still part of what is happening in the restaurant. 

Our server asked if we cared for a drink and went over the specials. They had several specials to chose from and their soup special was lobster bisque. I do not have a enough lobster bisque in my diet -really who does? - and it was great. Lobster and butter and some spice, a perfect combination.  

Our waiter was outstanding, we had an appetizer, and 2 courses. He timed them perfectly. My husband and I relaxed, made an slow meal of it and really enjoyed ourselves. The manager ended our evening with a lovely liqueur as a nightcap...free tasty booze, a step up from the free booze I will so happily accept.  

There was a gentleman setting up a keyboard and playing a few tunes as we left. Think Hotel California and anything by the Eagles. The bar is really attractive and spacious, not quite the decor of the dining room. I liked it and thought, I could hit this place up again for some drinks and a few noshes while I listened to some live music..

The food is great, I think it is a great value for the food prepared, the service you receive and the overall feeling. Yes, I would come for my prom, or my Rotary Dinner out or like myself, just dinner bcz I can't bear to cook - pick your poison, head to JH and be prepared to have a good meal and be serenaded by Eagles tunes.",5,3,2

The food was pretty good, their salsa is pretty odd imo, they had wood-burned flavored salsa that added to the food, but then again was not your everyday salsa that you'd expect. Kind of hit and miss on the salsa.

Other than that, the cheese enchiladas were pretty darn good. They kept refilling the water cups pretty fast and the waitress was really good at keeping up tabs with us.

Let's chat about their homemade sauces and hot sauces. Great variety and great flavor. Let's chat about their spicy guacamole and freshly fried tortilla chips. Each bite had a little kick to it making it totally unboring.

However, my caesar salad was boring, not gonna lie. The grilled shrimps were tasty, but overall the salad was huge in size, but not on flavor. I definitely added a ton of hot sauce and the garlic crema to add a bit of a kick.

My friend's tacos were touted as big, but they ended up not being huge. She's also a veggie and probably ordered wrong. And when I say probably, I mean she did. I'd also suggest ordering the flour vs corn tortillas as they looked absolutely authentically, hand made.

The brussels nachos were delicious but not what one expects. Their nachos are just your regular nachos with some brussels involved, not brussels sprouts covered in nacho cheese and the works, which is what I really wanted and so does everyone else in the entire world.

On a Friday night, we made our way to this church street spot. I was running late, so I called at last minute to push my reservation back. The man on the phone was understanding and had no problem. When we got there we were seated in 5 mins. It gave me a chance to peak at the first floor. I loved the the decor and the fire place. E were on the third floor and again the seating was beautiful. I wish we had a bigger party so we could get awindow seat but we got a take by the bar but it was away from everyone else. If you are a party of 5 or more, ask for a table by the windows or there is a private room on the third floor when you go up the stairs, it has a white table and chairs, away from the other patrons. 

Or waiter was really friendly. Suggested two drinks which I can't remember the name but they were good. 
We order e from the winterlicious menu $25. I got the tomato based soup and Dave got the gumbo. They were both okay, nothing crazy good. For mains I got the article char which was delicious, the skin was super crispy and the fish itself was most and tastey. It came with vegetables like roasted beets pumpkin and fennel along with sliced oranges and toasted nuts. It was good but the fish was better. Dave got the Cornish hen. It was also delicious. The skin was crispy, the inside moist. He said he enjoyed it. It came with a buttermilk bisque. When he bit into it his face changed, he was in biscuit heaven, who knew! I only had one but so I can't really explain it but it was that Good.
For dessert we had the ginger creme and the snow bar. Dave never had smores before, and my attempt at home to enlighten him has majorally failed. He really enjoyed it. It wasn't too much of anything. The right amount of gram the right amount of chocolate ganache and the right about of roasted marshmallow. It was delicious, I took two buttress instead of one. I had the ginger creme. It was good, light and not too sweet; after such a heavy meal, it was perfect. It was presented with oranges and slivered ginger on top.

Bill for two winterlicious $25 menu, plus two drinks (average about $15 each), our bill was $94 (tax and 15% tip included). 

Even though the restaurant was busy we were rushed to leave, the wait staff didn't try to wrap us wrap by constantly coming over. They were attentive but not to the point what you're not sure if they are tree trying to get you or of there.

First and foremost there is no communication between family members of a loved one receiving services. It is now at the end of March and my mom and I had Plan Of AZ send over ROI forms signed by mother and myself during some horrific times dealing with my brother and turned in the forms back in January. Since that time my brother has gotten a hold of illegal substances which of course alters mental status as he is already SMI and has gotten worse. As of recently PIR claimed they never received the ROIs back in January and claimed that they never received the numerous messages we sent in the past few months and said they couldnt return calls any way due to no ROI and HIPPA.  My brothers case manager, Natasha, is very arrogant and demeaning when she has spoken with my mother regarding my brother. Regardless they dont do anything or take any notation of checking my brother out when he goes through these spells. Of course Natasha insists she sees nothing wrong with my brother and is very short with my mom who has been handeling my brothers care for 16 long years. My mom is elderly and cant take much anymore with my brother. She has asked dor residential placement in at least a 16 hour facility as he is to vulnerable to live on his own and can not budget and is susceptible to abusiving illicit drugs. Nothing has been done about reaidential placement for 16 years. Natasha in a sense is getting paid to do nothing even though we have expressed concerns of his behavior as he at times is belligerent and could be a danger to himself and\/or others as a result of unpredictable capabilities while under the influence as a result. These people will be on the verge of getting sued if my brother commits DTS or DTO. We are trying to persuade my brother to go to another site. He refuses as he does not see any insight or judgement into his condition and is quite happy with Natasha as she is not thorough taking action when it comes to concerns from myself and my mother in regard to my brothers care. In a sense if Natasha does nothing, this enables my brother more to think its ok to still take street drugs without getting caught or confronted by his CM and\/or by his Doctor. My brothers CMs manager above her is just as bad as Natasha. These people are simply there for the money and think they are above everyone else in making every excuse in the book of not doing their job efficiently\/correctly.

In my opinion, don't waste your time even considering the Las Vegas location. It ranks far below the quality and service standards of the other Javiers locations. I've been to several of Javiers locations including Newport Beach, Irvine, and Las Vegas. 

My favorite dishes are the Cabo Azul, and the Mole Poblano. I also usually splurge on a few tamarind margaritas as well.  I have had these dishes often enough to know when they are prepared properly and when the kitchen is cutting corners.

On this visit my wife decided to split the Cabo Azul. It is described as: ""A Maine lobster enchilada in a creamy pasilla sauce, a grilled chile relleno stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab topped with a light relleno sauce, and a shrimp taco on a flour tortilla prepared Ensenada style. Served with refried black beans and white rice.""

When we got the dish, we were starved, even though we stuffed our faces with far too many chips with salsa. The dish was not as hot as it usually is. We just figured it sat under the warming lamps too long as the service was a little slow. We decided I would eat the shrimp taco, her the lobster enchilada and we would split the Chile Relleno. We also had 3 Tamarind Maragaritas at $18 a piece.

While we were eating the waitress came by to see how things were. Even though thedish wasn't as hot as I expected, I was fine with it and gave her an 'it's fine' grunt just wanting her to go away.

I grunted too soon. When my wife and I got to splitting the ""grilled chile relleno stuffed with Monterey Jack cheese, shrimp and fresh Dungeness crab topped with a light relleno sauce"" I was immediately disappointed. It was very difficult to cut the chile, as it cold and wasn't cooked at all. I managed to saw off a section and give it a try anyway. There was little to no cheese, the shrimp were no where to be found, the fresh Dungeness crab resembled and tasted like imitation Krab meat, and the sauce tasted like Cambells mushroom soup. I got the impression that they had a pile of ungrilled split Chiles in the kitchen where the chef grabs an icr cream scoop full of Krab filling and flings inside the Chile, spills some muchroom soup over it and trys to pass it off as Cabo Azul. Pure crap. 

We complained to our waitress about that portion of the dish (when in reality it was all pretty much sub-par). She took our plates away, no doubt destroying the evidence. She returned again in a little while with our bill that had no adjustment for the crappy chile relleno. She was suprised that we expected something and meekingly squeaked that she thought the manager had already come by. So she scurried off to get the manager (again). 

We waited what seemed like an eternity until 2 managers came by to set us straight about the order. There was a snooty middle-aged blonde woman and a young concern-feigning hispanic gentleman riding shotgun. She proceeded to scold us over not calling out the problem with the food when the waitress came by the first time (roughly 2 minutes after she set the plates down), and that we had ate some of the meal so it must have been good for us at the time. In her mind we were supposed to inspect and taste each portion of the plate and be ready sign a contract of acceptance moments after being given our meal. When we pointed out that might be a tad unreasonable, the hispanic gentleman explained that he would adjust the bill for that portion of the meal. Lets do some quick math and see what a reasonable person would expect. In Las Vegas the Cabo Azul is $36. Its made up of a Lobster Enchilada, a Dungeness Crab Chile Relleno, and a Shrimp Taco.  I would value them as Lobster: 14, Relleno 12, Taco 10.  They managed to give us a $6 credit.

We've been to this location twice now. Like I said, the others are far superior. There are far too many other places to go to in Las Vegas that take pride in thier meal preparation to ever bother going here again.",0,0,0

Its open pretty late and its located on the strip so most likely you'll be coming here for convenience purposes.  

Since it is located in a casino, the place looks nice and has a decent amount of seating.  Most of the staff speak Mandarin as well.

Menu is pretty vast from dim sum to noodle soups to fried rice to stir fried noodles.  As for us we tried the oxtail soup, shrimp dumplings, and some type of stir fried noodles.  Again, I would say the food is good to above average.  So overall we were pleased with the food.  

Best draw about this place is location, open late, and convenience.  One thing you probably won't like about this place is the price.  Again everything on the strip is expensive so not sure why people are complaining about that and lowering stars for that.

It's a friend's favorite pub but when I was younger and my tastes were different, I was never terribly fond of it.  I think that's because it's small and has the tendency to get mega crowded.  Now, that is still something which would put me off, but I know enough now to label it a week day pub.

When I walked in I remembered how much I did always like the interior.  It is a funny shaped pub which means that about half of the tables are tucked away in a corner.  From memory, they also have board games, which is very good fun.

The toilets -the ladies, at least- are clean and graffiti-free due to the chalk boards which are made available.

The absolute stars of the place are the bartenders.  I walked up to the bar and was within minutes asked where I'm from, how long I've lived in Edinburgh, what I do for a living.  The bartender was so good for a laugh I hardly noticed that my friend was 15 minutes late.
Another big plus is that, even in a very touristy area, my pint was 2.95.  I feel hard pressed to pay less than 3 for a pint these days and this made me very happy.

They simply state on the bill that you have 30 days to decline the 12 month contract, if they don't hear from you, well your done Boom in a contract. This happened to me because I called with intentions to cancel service, at the time I had a home phone and did cancel that.

Afterwards, the manager came and made excuse after excuse about how he couldn't keep an eye on everything. But that's your job as a manager- to manage. In the meantime that we're waiting for our food, the other table who claimed our food got their actual orders and we were still waiting. First, who claims food that they didn't order??!! Second, the manager offered us desserts and I said we didn't want any- so I asked for comps. He said that it ""may be difficult"" to comp but he would see what he would do. After we finally got our food- about 50 minutes after we sat down- he came back to say that we were comped. At least we were treated properly- because no good self-respecting restaurant should expect guests to pay for a meal that came unapologetically late. Two stars for effort and still-tasty malfalde. Zero stars for useless bus boys.",1,0,1

I love the design of this restaurant! They have big open windows that let beautiful natural light in during the day. At night, the dimly lit atmosphere gives an intimate vibe. They also have outside seating, which is first come first serve. It's only here that you can see the water show at Bellagio fountain. This was the perfect venue to celebrate my 25th birthday!

Complimentary baguettes: It's pretty cool how they serve their bread as a long baguette in a paper bag, not cut up. Very fresh!

Charcuterie & Cheese Platter: Included three different cheese, salami, grapes, three different pate, jam, mustard, nuts, slices of baguette. The cheese paired so well with the jam and mustard. I loved making different combinations of each item on my bread!

Prime Steak, Bernaise: There's a reason why they're known for their steak! It was tender, juicy, and perfectly paired with the bernaise sauce. I also loved their frites! They're thinly cut and crunchy...couldn't stop reaching over to my boyfriend's plate and stealing some.

Salmon: Classic salmon, flaky, well-seasoned. What blew me away was the peas puree and white cream butter sauce under the salmon. I couldn't stop dipping and swiping all my food into the sauce!

Casareccia Pasta: A very healthy pasta dish filled with peas, radish, asparagus, and a poached egg. The pasta was so soft, taste handmade. The sauce was very light, lemon-y, with a hint of cheese.

We also ordered:
Trout, again with amazing butter sauce.
Filet mignon, again with the tenderness and since it is a better cut of meat, much more juicy!

What a wonderful way to say Happy Birthday to my tastebuds\/stomach...they also brought out  complimentary profiterole with vanilla ice cream! I can't wait to come back and experience breakfast\/brunch with Mon Ami Gabi!",4,3,4

I've said it before and I'll say it again, someone ""up there"" means for me to be a vegetarian because, when I do eat meat, it has to be so abstracted from it's original form (i.e. McNuggets) to be edible. When I see real, meaty looking meat, I back away. I get all heeby-jeeby and I can't do it. 

That said, I ordered a regular ole' cheeseburger, poutine and a chocolate milkshake. As is normally the case when I'm faced with the ""how would you like it done?"" question, I answered ""Umm....like, really, really well done. Like, you could hit something with it afterwards and it wouldn't break."" So the burger, though apparently incinerated, was fine by my standards. 

The poutine and the chocolate shake, though, were fan-tastic! One of the better poutine's I have had in the city. 

Big Smoke Burger is small on the inside, with little room for frills. I guess the problem with lack of frills is that you wonder why you're paying $29 for two burgers when McDonald's would charge like $4 for the two AND you can play in the Play Place for free.

As the self-proclaimed halo-halo queen, believe me when I say that Magnolia is a must try! I sample halo-halo at every Filipino restaurant I go to and I am constantly seeking out new places to try. So much so that my dentist said I need to stop because the ice is damaging my teeth lol... but since my recent trip to the Philippines, I have been even more crazy about halo-halo and I just can't stop. 

Halo-halo is a popular Filipino dessert consisting of shaved ice, condensed milk, and give or take any of the following ingredients: various sweetened beans, sweetened ube (purple yam of the Philippines), various fruits (jack fruit, coconut, plantains, etc), gelatin, ice cream (most commonly ube-flavored) and leche flan (Filipino version of flan). Dubbed the MaHalo-Halo, Magnolia makes a fairly traditional halo-halo except for the crispy rice cereal on the top which is less common. This addition adds unexpected flavor and texture and I am a big fan! Weirded out by beans in a dessert? No worries, your halo-halo can be completely customized to omit or include any ingredients you'd like. You can even choose what ice cream flavor to top it off with. The best part for me, though, is the ice. It's soft and snow-like. This is not typical for halo-halo; you'll find that restaurants use ice shavers that dispense much rougher-cut ice. So, thank you Magnolia. I can eat my favorite dessert all the time without my dentist yelling at me ;) The regular-sized portion will cost you around $5, which is a good deal. On our last visit, we received a free small scoop of ice cream with our halo-halo purchase (their special at the time), sweetening the deal even further.

If halo-halo isn't your style, there are a variety of delicious ice cream flavors to choose from. They've got a few of your normal flavors if you're not too adventurous but my favorites are Buko Pandan and Mais Queso (coconut & screwpine leaves and corn & cheese, respectively). Hey, don't knock it til you try it!

At first one of the employe (lady with the gray hair) said ""sit here together because the other side of the room has no heater and we will count the bill separately"". Later when our food comes out this couple walk in and she seated them in the opposite side (side with apparently no heater.) We then ask to be seated in two different tables because the restaurant was literally empty and they said no & that they will separate the bill. So we ended up sitting in a big table after hearing that the bill will be separated. After they took our order the rude gray hair lady mumble in front of our face and said ""even if you're sitting together or not you're be still paying gratuity"" in such a disrespectful tone.

The restaurant was large with lot's of seating and is very clean. Service was great and very quick. Portions were huge and priced fairly at about $7 - $10 per dish.

We ordered five dishes to share (obviously I'm not using the official chinese names):

1)  Deep fried fish with cream corn - a favourite of mine. This was a good version but probably could have used a bit more cream corn given the large portion of rice.

2) Rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce - very good, not dry and the perfect ratio of veggies to noodles.

3) A new Chinese vegetable dish I never had before, kind of looked like green beans but harder like broccoli - so good and my new fav. chinese veggie dish.

4) Beef short-ribs with pepper & Garlic served on a hot plate - this was the only poor dish tonight, the meat was very tough and lacking significant flavour.

5) Sweet Eggplant - Amazing, one of the better eggplant dishes I tried and not oily like most.

The waffle was perfectly cooked with a crisp exterior and a soft and chewy interior. It was topped with a mess of bananas, warm buttery brown sugar sauce, and vanilla ice cream that, although nothing special on its own, melted into the butter-brown sugar sauce to form a next level creation. Yum. My latte had a bit too much foam for my liking, but was otherwise very good.

My girlfriend told me she used arizonadriver.com before, and it was simple.  I decided one is probably as good as the other, so I went with this company.  I have no real basis of comparison (except a classroom course I took a decade ago) but I have to say the online ""course"" and ""tests"" are simple, but getting started was annoying.

I faxed a copy of my driver's license and citation to the company on Thursday night.  Having a nearly completely free Friday afternoon, I decided not to wait (up to 24 hours) for an email or call from them.  When I called around 12:30pm I was told my driver's license was too dark, and they did not get the citation.  I guess it was too hard for them to call or email me about that when they received the fax.  Not having a scanner or fax at home, and wanting to get everything taken care of fast, I ran to a copy shop, overpaid to scan my stuff, then emailed it to them.  A couple hours later (and after a second phone call), I finally got the email saying I qualified.

After that, everything was easy.  It's actually so mind-numbingly simple that if you can't get at least three of the four questions right without reading the material, please stop driving immediately.  However, to prevent you from speeding through, there is a timer that keeps you from moving to the next chapter until the minimum time has elapsed.  So make sure you have some way to entertain yourself during a very long four and a half hour process (I took care of it all in one sitting).  The final is a rehash of the questions they already told you they'd be asking, so it's pretty hard not to get 100%.  The final can now be taken online for free, and you can print a copy of the certificate for yourself.

Very nice place, great ambiance... I was impressed, however wise enough to know that books AND restaurants shouldn't be judged on the surface. I frequent many sushi bars and some of the best sushi I've eaten can be found in much less elegant of establishments - don't be fooled!

We ordered 5 maki rolls to start:

2 from their 'signature' menu (firecracker roll and the madi gras roll)
I love spicy food of all kinds - the firecracker roll was just HEAT, no FLAVOR, big upset. The madi gras roll was plain and flavorless. You'd be hard pressed to find a piece of lobster in there and they must have run out of cilantro because no tasty herb anywhere!! Keep in mind, these are signature rolls, $12+ a roll. 

The other 3 rolls were from their 'traditional' selection.. We got the following:
Las Vegas roll - ok, the sushi to rice ratio was about 20\/80, not impressed at all.
Eel roll - eel?? Where was the eel? 
Spicy scallop roll - Zero spice and quite frankly it tasted like mushy rice.. The consistency was way off... Also take note that these 'traditional rolls' are no bigger than a quarter in diameter, very small for almost $10 per roll, ridiculous!!

Our waiter saw my puzzled look as he brought out these rolls and never once asked if there was a problem or how our food was when he brought the check.. Which brings us to $$
Our total was $55 for the most ridiculous lunch I've ever had.. Thanks, or NO thanks to the Groupon, we then owed $25 for really NOTHING more than an upscale environment!

Check in went smoothly and my room was absolutely beautiful. Did I have the best view of Las Vegas at night? Not really since we weren't on the strip, but it was a nice view nonetheless. And if you really think about it... how much time do you actually spend in your hotel room when you're in LAS VEGAS?

The hotel is split by towers, Fantasy and Ivory. I stayed in the Ivory tower and have no complaints whatsoever. Of course they have a ton of gaming machines on the first floor along with a diner\/cafe, buffet, and several other eating establishments towards the opposite end. I would recommend you get the Palms card since you get to enjoy discounts at certain establishments at the Palms and it's free to get.

Shuttles run every so often to Caesar's Palace. However, you should try to make the line for that early since the shuttle bus is tiny and fits 12 people, if that. There are also airport shuttles available for $7 and they drop you off at your terminal, regardless of the airline.

Service was average and the ambiance was below average as we were seated in the ""skyyard"" which is up top near the rooftop patio.  Tables were very close together and very little privacy. 

We had the $35 winterlicious dinner and a glass of red wine each.  Total was just under $100 plus tip.  We both had the vegi hand roll app which was decent.  Main course I ordered the half chicken dinner and my GF had the cauliflower truffle risotto.  The chicken was actually pretty good (cooked nicely with a tasty gravy) I would give it a 7\/10.  My GF's risotto dish was terrible and maybe the worst risotto either of us have ever eaten - 1\/10.  It was like regular white rice in a cream sauce.  Very bland and disappointing.  The desserts (Banana chocolate cake and burnt caramel custard) were also quite bland.  The custard was more of a jello type structure and not at all what I would consider a ""custard"".  

Overall I felt like the value just wasn't there for the money we spent.  Also, the winterlicious promo price of $35 doesn't seem to be that big of a discount from their regular menu pricing.  Our entrees were priced $19 and $22 on the regular menu so the value of the winterlicious offering is questionable to say the least.

I noticed this cute little cafe across from the Kirk, named Cafe Vivo, and I decided to take advantage of the 3.95 Soup, crusty bread and tea offer it had in the window, perfect to heat me up! 

Upon entering, I noticed the cafe was lovely and simply decorated in blues and creams, with a few little personal touches and pictures up which added to the cosy feel of the place. It was quite busy, but luckily a couple vacated their seats just as we were ordering, so we got a table. The cafe is small and can seat around 10-15 people at a push.

We ordered the soup deal; I had chicken and veg and my boyfriend had spinich and chickpea, which sounded delicious. We sat down and the lovely waitress brought over a huge teapot with cups and sugar lumps, I could not wait to get it into me!

The soup came in what can only be described as small boats, filled to the brim with hot, piping soup. It was delicious, packed full with veg and chicken, just what I was looking for. I had a wee taste of my boyfriend's soup too, and it was really nice and different from the norm, packed with wilted spinach leaves. The soup was accompanied by three thick slices of crusty bread, and by the time I was done, I was so stuffed!

The boyfriend and I went there at around 11am on Sunday. I thought the crowd would have died down by then. Wrong! 25 min or so wait. Oh well. at least there are benches to wait on. 

Walking in I was struck by the lack of atmosphere. I had gone to their old location once and while this place is bigger, it lacks the character the other location had so that was a bummer.

We got a table near the wall. This place is packed! The tables are very close together so if you want to have a private conversation you came to the wrong place. Also, they don't have any sound dampeners so it's very loud in there. The woman at the table next to us was practically yelling her conversation.

But the saving grace was the food. It was really good. I had the brioche french toast with bananas and pecans and boyfriend had a breakfast burrito. My french toast was done perfectly and had a nice caramel syrup on it that wasn't too sweet. The burrito was big and had a good flavor as well. The eggs were nice and creamy.

Regarding Starbucks store #6893 - I've had a bad experience every time I have ever gone to this location. Today was the tipping point. When I walked through the door I thought someone said hello and welcome to Starbucks. Turns out she was talking to someone in the drive-thru. 

There were at least three people behind the counter yet no one said a word to me for at least 30 seconds while I stood at the counter until a lady who was standing right on the other side of the counter told another person that he had a customer. The man then walked two steps to the register and took my order. I told him I had two rewards on my gold card and that I wanted to use one of them to pay. He said okay, took my card, swiped it and gave it back to me with my receipt. I looked at it and saw that I was in fact, charged for my drink. For some reason, I have never been able to use my drink rewards at this location and they never tell me this. They always charge me and I find out about it after the fact.

Turned off by my experience, I decided to let it go and follow up online. I waited for my drink. Another person started making it then put my cup to the side and started making another drink for a lady who arrived after me. She got her drink first then the person continued making mine. When my drink was finished, the woman called out my order, put it on the counter and threw (yes, THREW) a straw in my direction. It landed on the counter. I had a straw in my hand already so I tossed it back over. 

I have no idea what the story is with this location.  I have never seen more than 3 or 4 customers inside or in the drive thru yet the people who work here have such awful attitudes.  I just read some reviews of this store on Yelp and it appears I am not alone in this opinion.  This location is completely out of control. Is it a franchise or something?",1,0,0

Unfortunately, that lasted all of one week and the same practices were reverted back to.  
 
Couple of Comments ----

#1 - I recommend taking your business to an alternative Credit Union location.  My preferred business is America First.  They're timely, convenient, and thorough.  You can go to ATMs and branches for quick and convenient transactions.

#2 - The One Nevada Credit Union location off of Stephanie and Eastern do not issue cash at their desks.  If you want to withdraw a higher figure, you will have to go to the bank and have the bank teller enter in the withdrawal amount in their system and will direct you to an ATM to make the withdrawal.  In essence, two lines?? Now they say after you've banked with them long enough, you will be able to make the request over the phone for the withdrawal amount increase and then visit an ATM.  (Each time you need it.  Inconvenient right?  The Manager attempted to recover my dissatisfaction on this aspect and said he would call me when I was expecting my deposits to offer to enter in the information for me ahead of time, so that things were prepared.  Well, that happened only the one time an apology was offered.  And conveniently for them, after I had deleted my old Yelp rating.)

#3 The Personal Banker (Anna Poppo?) asked me if I wanted her to enroll me online so I can access to my banking information once I left the bank.  Although I declined, she still proceeded to arrange this.  Not sure if she gets credit for this or something? But why ask if you are not really giving me the option.

#4 About 2 months with my new account, I get a phone call from this Personal Banker.  She advised that she had not obtained a signature (or ensured it was legible on her end), so she asked me to come to the bank again to sign.  Now for the majority, this may not be a big deal; however, most of my complaints stem from being medically put on bedrest and having limitations with going out.  Now because she failed to ensure something was solidified, I again have to have the inconvenience of making another trip to their branch for something they failed to check.  (As a side note:   I anticipate that it was because the original account was opened on a Friday afternoon close to closing, she rushed to just get this done as fast as possible.). When I eventually went to the bank, the acting manager had no idea what to do when it came to obtaining the missing information. (Archived signature.) Comforting right?

In closing to the Bank Management Team, don't waste your time attempting to recover in an effort to have me delete my sentiments.  I feel that the population should be made aware of the inconveniences and sloppy behaviors exhibited by One Nevada.",1,0,0

A few things, this seems better suited for breakfast\/dessert crepes.  The savory crepes are good, but the desert crepe is their main draw for sure! The sweet crepes are amazing! 

The other neat thing they do are the stuffed Belgian waffles.  This is a really unique item, but could benefit from a higher quality syrup. The syrup they use is the generic type of syrup. If they had high quality syrup it would take the waffles over the top. 

My recommendation, stick with the sweet crepes or the breakfast type crepes.

I had an appointment at 6:30 but they still made me wait 25 minutes (there were 4 just hanging around doing nothing at this time). I waited it out though because at least it was comfy and one of the staff had brought her cat to the salon.

I had initially gone in wanting coffin nails but when I asked for them, the lady doing my nails made a face and strongly suggested against that shape. I'm no nail expert so I just went with it.

I told her I wanted shellac- something nude and silver, somewhat elaborate because it was for a wedding. She couldn't really suggest to me any ideas but got out some silver nail jewels so my hopes were high. 

However as time went on I became more and more disappointed. She placed the jewels in an unappealing way and then tried to make them fancier by adding some very ugly (and not even straight!) glitter lines. Then she got to the end and basically realized they didn't look great but didn't really know how to fix them. 

At one point she asked me ""is this wedding fancy?"" and then made a face like ""I dun goofed"" when I said that it was.

Long story short, after 2 hours (2.5 if I count the wait), and $60(!!!), I ended up with nails that look like I did them at home, the only thing I liked about them was the colour (which I chose myself). 

I would have stayed and insisted they fix it but it was pretty close to 9 pm, I was the only one there and they looked like they wanted me gone asap (even though it seemed obvious they were not a fan of their own work). So I just cut my losses and went home. They told me to come back with a picture for next time (they didn't even ask for one at the beginning!)

As a bonus, when I got home I saw that there was a cat hair embedded between layers of polish.

They told me that if the nails get chipped etc within the next week they'd fix it for free, but being realistic I am never going back.",3,0,1

I don't want to give away too much detail about the show but I will say that it's pure fun. They're extremely interactive and engaging - lots of table dancing aka getting up close and personal with the dancers and crowd contests. 

Here are a couple noteworthy tidbits to know:
- I'd suggest buying the cheapest tickets available because you'll more than likely end up being moved to a better spot in the center of the crowd which is what happened to me and it was FABULOUS!
- This is an 18+ year old show - yes, gotta corrupt them at their prime (jk!)

So I guess I will just run down the list of things that stood out to me.

I came here for a private event, which was catered and had music and dancing.  That part was fun.  The space is fairly modern and very white, with a track of race cars angling down a ramp above your head.  It's kind of cool to pick out all the various sponsors on the cars, and if you were a racing fan, I'm sure you would enjoy identifying the numbers on the cars.  For non-fans though, perhaps the most interesting thing is the several displays of wreckages, accompanied by videos showing the crash.  When you see the twisted heaps of metal up close and personal, it's pretty amazing that the drivers walk away from the crashes unscathed more often than not.

There's another section to the Hall that I didn't investigate, but I am guessing it had displays about the history of racing, or at least I hope it does.  Given that this is one of the top tourist attractions in Charlotte, it's worth stopping by, even if just to watch the spectacular crashes playing on a loop.",8,5,5

If you're interested in not scaring off future businesses taking risks I suggest the locals learn to support the small business and try to think(eat) outside the box.

Review: 
We started with the queso. Nothing special, but it was original. Probably won't have many fans of this tapas dish. So if you aren't open minded, just pass. 

We also shared the croquetas which were good. The chorizo and goat cheese were barely existent. still had a good taste. Would compare it to a deep fried tamale. Yes small portions... But that's tapas. Traditional Spanish tapas.

Shrimp and grits were top notch. Grits were cooked perfectly. The honey ginger on the shrimp did not shine through, but still had a great taste.

Tamales in size have been upgraded according to the others at my table. They were not traditional tamales, but they also had a great taste. The golden raisins and poblano sauce added some nice complexities to the flavor.

Finally, the entre. The salmon. Very tasty with a mustard cream base and Yukon potatoes. Really hearty dish.

If it makes them happy and keeps smiles on their faces while they are working, then have at it!

Service (5): I had researched the menu to find something before I had arrived (no one wants to stand behind a newbie while they ask a million questions on the menu).

That will never happen again. I tell everyone I know to stick with Dignity Health if possible and Phoenix Children's if not and to avoid Banner. First off the care was subpar that my son received. The day of his surgery his nurse disappeared for several hours leaving him in severe pain. The P.A. in the E.R. referred him to surgery and then the doctor on staff (not the surgeon) came in and gave us incorrect information while we were waiting for the surgeon. I saw this as a billing ploy. This is the only facility we have been to where we seem to be sought out by out of network doctors like vultures. Upon checkout we received instructions for car seat safety and other baby specific instructions. My son was 13 and had an appendectomy. None of our dismissal papers were specific to appendicitis. We didn't receive the normal list of if this happens return to hospital, call dr., etc. My son was sent home still with a fever spiking at 103. It was spiking when he was discharged. Basically I was plenty unhappy with the lack of care. Then I started receiving the several bills. After insurance the hospital bill alone was over $3000. We aren't wealthy people so on countless times I called billing to try to figure out a reasonably affordable payment plan. There were no options and no help for insured (even for people with crappy insurance). So I struggled to make the $150\/month payments. This July we had to move on short notice out of state. I called the billing department to let them know I wouldn't be able to make payments for a few months ahead of missing any payments. Today I called to try and reset a payment plan. I struggle to make the $150\/month payments. I was informed that unless I made up the missed payments I would be sent to collections. I said I can't afford to pay $450. The next offer was to pay $300 for September and October and then they would start the payment plan in November back at $150\/month. The last and best offer was pay $300 in September and then pay $150\/month starting in October. There needs to be more compassion and more willingness to work with people who want to pay their bills. I have no problem paying what I owe. I don't understand a company that would rather send me to collections than work with me. Both Dignity Health and Phoenix Children's have worked with me in the past to get my accounts paid off and I have succeeded. Their medical care is also superior to Banner Health. I don't worry that doctors will be vultures in the E.R. trying to do anything in order to bill me.",0,0,0

prixatWkNraj-sxXUcwItQ,P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg,bk4FIHt8ODRBPfqL4Fd2aQ,3,2009-07-31,"With over ""10,000 combinations"", there is a burger here for everyone - that is the motto here.   Indulge isn't a boutique burger joint.  You can have a burger as simple as pickles tomatoes onions and ketchup, or you can venture into the unknown with brioche cranberry chutney gruyere and turkey.  It is build your own, or sample one of their signatures.

I am a snacker, so I liked that the experience starts off with a sampling of their garlic parmesan chips. What would make these perfect would be a dusted Parmesan, or melted Parmesan with white truffle oil.  Currently, the way they are prepared and presented is a poor foreshadowing of what is to come.

Build your own burger is great. It's like a sushi menu for burgers. On the menu, one marks their selections with penicl. Choices go from A-F. Chooose your protein, (salmon, Kobe, turkey, etc) cheese, (Danish bleu cheese, herb goat cheese spread, gruyere) bun, (brioche, English muffin, wheat) sauces, (apricot chipotle, aioli, cranberry chutney, Bangkok peanut sauce, cactus ranch, honey citrus pepper, and more) regular toppings, (baby greens, roasted chiles, boiled egg slices, pineapple, grilled onions) and indulge toppings (avocado, fried egg, chili con carne, honey cured bacon, and more).

Kids have a four item menu that includes a peanut butter and jelly wrap.

It is very important that I record the appetizer list here.  Essentially, it is what would otherwise come with a standard burger.  Happy hour patrons and ladies are lured by the 1\/2 appetizers offerings here, but there is not variety.  There is starch, more starch, carbohydrates, beans and protein, or a small side salad.  *shakes head.*

Appetizers:
Sweet potato fries
Fried dill pickle chips
Onion strings and regular fries
Chili
Side salad

I think vegetarians or ""healthy"" eaters will still find something for their palates here, such as the salad with Bleu cheese, strawberries, and walnuts.  There is also a grilled veggie pesto sandwhich on the menu, as well as the Veggie homemade burger. (fresh ingredients blended in special sauces including herbs, spices, beans, and rice)

Sandwhiches:
Blackened or grilled grouper
Fried bologna
3 cheese

There is a list of signature burgers, and I chose the first one on the list, the ""Vesuvius volcanic,"" the specially cooked burger with molten cheese. It arrived perhaps 15 minutes later, a la carte.  FYI, none of the burgers or signature sandwhiches come with fries.  I like that those fries aren't there to distract me, it's why I never finish a burger in a restaurant.

Hence, I was actually able to finish my volcanic burger.  The unique aspect of it is that molten American cheese is inside of the meat patty. You take that first bite intoo your burger, and the hot molten cheese comes bursting out. Downside is that this is the only kind of cheese that so lovingly melts inside the pattie. Not a fan of American cheese. It tastes like that plastic pseudo cheese made from oil and water - that you used to eat as a fun snack when you were a kid.  Well, it is no longer fun, and I think it somewhat spoils the taste of the burger.

The Downside of burgers not coming with fries...you are still paying between 10-12 dollars for a burger, without the generous side of potatoes.

Service was friendly and attentive, but slow like others have mentioned.  Places like this I recommend sitting at the bar.

Overall, it is an A-OK.  The concept is great, the burger patties are very generous and well prepared.  I think the prices are higher than they need to be, and this place just doesn't set itself apart from other places of its kind.  Burger adventurers may enjoy this place more than myself, as there are some unique additions you can make to an otherwise standard burger.

I arrived on a Friday night just in time for happy hour (about 4pm). I didn't really know what I was getting myself into other than a decent drink special. Of course upon our arrival the ""wheel"" was on $5 patron shots. Okay!  My work wives and I decided this was just what we needed to loosen up post conference. Apparently the happy hour wheel gets spun every 30-minutes, each time highlighting a different drink special. So it began.. $5 patron shots quickly followed by $6 margaritas, $3 fireball shots, $4 domestic beers... And eventually we lost count and cannot remember the rest of the happy hour specials we indulged in. Ouch! 

One thing I do remember is the nachos!  Those were HUGE and amazing!  For the same price you can choose chicken, steak or a combo of both. Lots of tasty meat, fresh guac, sour cream, pico, olives, jalapeos, and a house HOT sauce!  Yumm. Between 4 gals, we didn't even get through this gargantuan!

It did not. I tried everything I could think of, Windex, the dental floss method, sticking my hand in a bowl of ice and holding my hand over my head to get the swelling down, but after tugging for what seemed life forever, my ring finger was so swollen I was contemplating going to the ER to get it cut off. I had heard horror stories about getting rings cut off at the ER and decided to try to get it cut off (that bad boy was simply not going to come off on its own) at a jewelry store instead. 

After seeing the reviews on Yelp for Jewel Trendz and being so close to my house I decided to give it a try and I am so so glad I did. They did everything to reassure me that my rings were salvageable and after evaluating my situation, cut it in a way that would not damage the diamond and sapphire settings (unlike the ER which would have just snapped the ring off). Both rings are pretty thick and soldered together and they were super gentle while cutting them, making sure to check if I needed a break during the cutting or that I didn't get caught by sharp pieces. After releasing my finger from its stranglehold, they gave me back the pieces and suggested I wait a week to let the swelling go down before getting it repaired. I was so grateful to have my finger back and asked how much I owed them but they charged me NOTHING! I was so shocked because it was a pain to cut through!

Yesterday, (Monday after I stupidly put on my too small ring) I took the pieces back to Jewel Trendz to not only have repaired, but to have sized as well. I was told my ring would be done on Wednesday and it would be $150 for both bands. I was shocked again! I had one ring resized at Fred Meyers (in the mall) that had an incredibly thin band and was charged $80 with a pick up date of a week! Well today, (Tuesday) I was surprised to get a call from Jewel Trendz saying my rings are ready! I couldn't believe how fast that it was to get my rings back! I am incredibly impressed, the work that was done is beautiful - I can't even tell where the rings were cut! And they fit now!

Can you imagine my disappointment? My one night off and what I craved was sub-power. I remember the California sandwiches down off of College  and Grace, Toronto.

Had the pea leaf salad (good but tasted like every other Asian house salad you can get anywhere), Sui Mai trio (best thing we had most likely), crispy Buddha spring rolls (they were egg rolls), asparagus, twenty vegetable fried rice (tasted like regular fried rice), and the Ants on a Log (pretty good spicy cellophane noodles) but nothing stuck out as amazing. The Siu Mai was extremely tiny but the most flavorful.

Our dessert was the best part of the night. Got the churro which was okay and came in a glass of hot chocolate. But the mango sticky rice was a mango jelly with cinnamon Rice Krispies(?), and cream. Bomb. 

Also everything was dressed with wilted watercress and the plates were very small. Our server Angie was very nice as well.

Even bread took around 20 mins to bring out. Yes, it was fresh baked, crispy, chewy and scrumptious, but why did it take so long?! They also failed to bring out the pizza with the salad which left me even hungrier. Salad by the way was a pile of lettuce and nothing else for $7. Now for the good stuff.

I ordered off the set menu since it was a work event. The salad was probably the best part of the meal. It was mixed greens, pine nuts, goat cheese and butternut squash. The squash really differentiated it from other mixed green salads. I ordered the steak frites. It was way too chewy (I have my steak medium rare). I only finished half of it because I got tired of chewing. My colleagues enjoyed their steak so one of them tried mine and agreed - way to chewy, he had to just force it down. I guess it was just my steak that was sub par. The dessert was a disaster. White chocolate brownie was turned into what tasted like a dense, dry cake mix with a crusty sweet bottom.

I've also tried their Bak Kut Teh but found that not so much too my taste.  If you enjoy a semi dry curry dish, I can suggest their Beef Rendang which is a very traditional Malaysian food.

Ok, I'll give it a try - I've eaten here about 65 times, give or take. From all of those experiences, I can remember possibly 4 or 5 of them being less than perfectly pleasant. Granted, one must make sure to manage their expectations when walking into Monty's. The wait can be up to a half hour most nights (no reservations accepted), and weekend brunches can find you standing in cue for over an hour, easily. 
With those caveats in mind, one should know this: there is nothing at Monty's that isn't homemade. Everything is fresh and, if not delicious then, supremely passable. 
Soups rotate daily and have never let me down (though I wouldn't dare order fish chowder on a Monday lunch break). Specials are always, well, special. While most dinners are content to pass off a standard entree as a special so long as it's adorned with added bacon or served on a different style of bread, Monty's really goes all out with their daily's. 
Prices are a little high, but not outrageous. As a general rule prepare to pay $1-2 more than you would expect for almost every sandwich or entree. 
Amazing options are the chicken pot pie, meatloaf (seriously), Reuben, Feta-Dill Burger, spicy chicken sandwich, and literally any cold entree salad. 
Everything else is merely good to great. 
Also, I've found that it's a great place to bring kids. Just try to avoid the supremely busy times of the week, it's loud enough in there without little Kailyenne (God, kids names suck these days....amirite??) throwing a tantrum. Although, should young Owlivr throw a fork at a server, busser, or host, it would be deflected by the force field that is the hardest working and most amazingly kind service staff in the city. 
Seriously, the people here are rock stars. I hear they can even endure the occasional 47 year-old, hyper-entitled, west-side residing, trust funded man child from hell.

The g\/f and I went there to enjoy their Loaded Carne asada tacos.  They were not what they used to be, but still good nonetheless.  That's about all that I can say was good about the experience.  The Refried beans were gross (they tasted slightly sour) and the same for the rice which also tasted old.  The service was near the bottom of all experiences I've had.  Not the worse, but pretty bad.  Never offered a refill on my beer.  My g\/f was never offered  a refill on her water.  Both of us had empty glasses before we finished our meal.  They were still empty when we left.  

The worse part was how they served us food and failed to bring out utensils.  I asked the waitress who brought the food for utensil and she was never to be seen again!  So after about 3 minutes of waiting I asked another waitress.  She came back after a few minutes with utensils.  So we were able to enjoy our meal 5 MINUTES AFTER IT ARRIVED.  No bueno!  So we are trying to enjoy our meal and the table next to us experience the same thing...  but only worse.  They get their food and no utensils, so they ask the waitress for some and she says, she will get them.  She then walks over to the register and works on fixing some orders.  Now mind you the people who asked her for the utensils can clearly see that the waitress was not getting them because she was 5 feet from their table.  After waiting 5 minutes themselves with their food in front of them and the waitress they originally asked for them, they finally ask another waitress for the utensils.  They still had to wait another few minutes.  I can only imagine how cold their food was.  About a minute later, I saw a woman waiting by the bar who appeared irritated.  She waited for about 3 minutes and not a single waitress or bar tender was in sight.  She then went to the hostess at the front entrance.  What was she upset about...  She had her food WITHOUT ANY UTENSILS.  This is a restaurant for crying out loud!  By this point, I'm pissed off that what we experienced was very similar to what others were experiencing, so this seemed to be the norm, rather than a one time thing that a simple apology would do.  The waitresses disdain for each other was clearly evident as well.

The dog was on a short leash, never barked, did not approach any customer or staff member, the opposite in fact happened - staff and customers approached him. He did not sniff around, was not a nuisance and well behaved throughout the visit and never disruptive. Mr. Freeman chose to stand there and argue his point no matter the fact that he should have never asked the second question (although he never completed the full first question either). Mr. Freeman was very obnoxious and even after his ""12 hours of ADA training,"" still unfamiliar with the details.",0,0,0

Sub par burgers and even crappier service. After having an absolutely horrific experience I sent an email to management...think I got any acknowledgement? Heck no.

So...the burger patty is small, not great and bland as all get out. Let me also mention that this burger is anything but cheap. I got the signature burger which they refuse to let you put condiments on...which if you have a good patty is fine, but if you have a soggy, mealy crappy patty you need some ketchup at the very least.
The restaurant was quite full and after waiting nearly ten minutes for our milkshake that we ordered with our burger and watching about 5 other people go up and get shakes that had come in after us we finally went to the counter and asked...we were told it would be right up. Another five minutes...a shake appears...and is given to someone else. Another 5 minutes burgers and now the shake are up...

Burgers ordered medium rare  are raw and returned, placed back on the grill and then amazingly back on the original bun. Seriously? You want me to pay a shit ton of money and you're gonna give me the same soggy ass bun? This ended up going in the trash.

I went up to the counter to get a drink. The owner was there at the cash and was on the phone taking an order. No acknowledgement of me whatsoever. His partner leans over and asks what I want. I ask for a grape Boylans. I get a cream soda. I ask again for a grape Boylans and grudgingly I get given one...for $2.60.

Bottom line? For three burgers one fry, one shake, one water and one boylans we paid just over 50 dollars and got about 50 cents worth of service.

I decided to try Sushi Kaya off a couple of recommendations I had received from friends. Upon entering, my boyfriend and I were happily greeted by the employees, and seated at a nice sized table. 

Upon first glance, the menu seemed similar to places like Yama, with a lot of roll and nigiri options. In addition to those, they had skewers, appetizers, and desserts as well. After we had received our first order, the service kind of slowed down for us. In their defense they were kind of busy, but after waiting for what felt like 15 minutes to give our next order, it kind of started to annoy me. 

As for the sushi.. The nigiri tasted fresh, but was a lot smaller in comparison to what I've received at other restaurants like Goyemon or Yama. This can be a good or bad thing depending on what type of sushi eater you are. I eat mainly nigiri, since rolls aren't really my thing, so I prefer more substantial sized pieces. I do recommend you try the cajun albacore though, you won't regret it!

Plus they had an amazing deal going on for a full set of lashes, $199 for $79, and I could not pass that up! Scheduling the appointment itself was very quick and easy. Coming home late from work, I was still able to message the owner of the studio, Nastica, and she was able to book me a last minute appointment for the next day, which I gladly appreciated. 

Since it was my very first time getting my lashes done, I did not know what to expect. The building itself was very modern and chic with mood-setting music in the background. The room had a comfortable recliner and a fuzzy blanket to keep you warm throughout the process of gluing your extensions on. 

My lash artist was Courtney. She was beyond sweet and helpful on determining which length would work best with my eye shape and eyebrows. As well as answering the multiple questions that I had, since this was my first set of eyelash extensions. As she was gluing the extensions, she was thorough and gentle. You could barely feel that the eyelashes were being applied. Even though the process took almost 3 hours, I did not mind because I'd rather have her take her time and ensure that the lashes were on correctly and securely. I would highly recommend Courtney to anyone. She made me feel comfortable and is truly amazing at what she does. 

All in all, I was very pleased with how my lashes turned out. Full, voluminous, and exceeded my expectations. You cannot go wrong with this lash studio. You will leave happy and feel like a million bucks after! Thank you again Bella Lash Studio, you earned yourself a loyal customer! :)",1,0,1

Of course because it's a specialty shop and they have unique flavors, you end up spending nearly $20 on 3 1.5 inch undersized desserts.

I had the vanilla, salted caramel, and the chocolate. The only one I found notable was the chocolate one. The cream inside was tasty.  

Other than that, not much to be blown away by except for the presentation.  

I went in on a sunday afternoon around 3 p.m. and 60% of the eclairs were gone but it looked like they were still making more to replenish.

I would recommend it for a novelty purchase if you're in the area. The parking is little to none. Very little street parking. So I hope you intend to come by foot, or have someone waiting in your car, keeping it running.

Perhaps if the price point was lower I could give you more stars.",2,0,0

They offer a variety of decent locally brewed beers, which was exciting. The beers were nearly all $5.

I literally just had to bring the cake and the rest was taken care of by Makutu's. I was a bit nervous before as I had been to a weekend party when she was in Kindergarten and it was a madhouse with parents having a hard time finding their kids. We've definitely played here when our kids were younger and had a blast (with a parent having to climb through with the littles), but for birthday parties I think 6+ is the ideal age. Since we did our party on a weekday after an early release day from school, it wasn't at all crowded. My daughter was easily able to find all her friends and they all had a blast together. Our party host Laurel did a good job confirming our choices for all the options (what type of pizza, type of drinks, if we want a free character visit, t-shirt size for the free b-day t-shirt signed by all her friends, do we want to open presents there or at home, etc.) and following through on it all. She automatically stored refrigerator items for us, had all the included tokens counted out, and had all the provided goody bags ready to go. They give the birthday child a free jump on the bungee jumper (which, by the way, is awesome... I've never seen one where kids go as high as this one and my daughter loved it) and a free pass to come back and play another time. After play time and party room time, the kids can stay and play as long as you want even though the official party time is over... also a nice touch. They do a good job at checking wristbands on the way out, so you don't have worry about kids escaping... you may not always be able to see them in the crazy climbing structures, but you know they're in there somewhere.

I ordered the campfire s'mores shake, which is the most amazing shake I have ever had. The alcohol in the shake was very subtle, and the shake was just.. perfect. no other words.

The lobster mac and cheese- pieces of lobster with mac and cheese and truffle oil. As a big fan of truffle oil, this dish was perfect for me. So far, so good.

Then the burgers- the gold standard and the billionaire.
I hate blue cheese, so had only regular cheddar cheese with the gold standard. It was a good burger, the ingredients were paired well and I was satisfied.
The billionaire burger- wgayu and foie gras- was ok. Because foie gras was banned in California, it was a must that we got that burger. However, the burger was a bit dry, and did not meet up to par.

The oatmeal cream pie was large, but had a ""minty"" taste in the cream, hmmm not sure if a fluke.  The PB brownie was good - not overly sweet, still something I would not try again.  The plain brownie was hard and crispy on the outside (not sure if on purpose) but soft inside - still flavorful. The cheesecake bites & eclair - nothing memorable.  The cupcakes is what made this place worth the expense, limited parking & traffic fight to get to.  They were delicious, fluffy, light and the two different flavors didn't taste like each other - by that I mean the batter had a distinct flavor.  Some of the other cupcakes in the area including in Scottsdale all have the same batter taste - hard to explain, but no matter what flavor you chose they all taste the same, these did not.  They tasted like the flavor they were supposed to be.  Strawberry tasted like 'strawberry', vanilla tasted just like vanilla and not like the same batter as the strawberry with vanilla, etc.  Lets just say they were a hit, and this is a tough crowd to please.

Do not sit in the The Ringers Sports Bar and Racing Casino at Planet Hollywood, that area is reserved.  Would be nice to be redirected nicely. So, yes that was a down point for us.

So we decided to get and pedicures over the weekend and I had never been. Boyfriend and his parents go all of the time together and his Dad especially loves them.

We looked at a couple of places closer to home on Yelp, but they seemed more expensive with their a la carte and package deals, and Lobo is where boyfriend and his family always go so we went with the tried and true. 

I was really pleased with the shop, nothing spectacular and high end, but I didn't expect that. if I was going to have a whole spa day, sure I may expect more, but this was some routine maintenance right? Perfectly suited for the need. The place was clean, chairs were comfortable, and everyone was super friendly.

We got the deluxe pedi package and added on some extras, but we had the sugar scrub with massage, lotion massage, hot stones, and a nail buff. 

They were pretty busy with what seemed like a lot of regulars, that's a good sign. Every single tech i saw was either on someone's hands or feet working away. 

They had a couple of TV's on with football playing (Sunday afternoon, so yeah) and that made it interesting to me - having a pedicure while watching football. Can I get a beer?

Came on Monday for breakfast and it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated right away and gave us water within seconds. We ordered the basic, the fried chicken and waffle and I was going for the chicken pot pie dish (because I saw it on yelp) and the lady said they don't have it for breakfast.. ok fine. I scanned the menu quick and realize I can't decide quick enough and it'd be better if she came back so I told her kindly to just come back and we'll order when I make my mind and she wasn't so happy about that. 

We let her know I was ready and waited for her to come back to take our order which took about 10-15 minutes. I get it, you got tables to wait I respect that but she was not doing her job. By the time she put the order in for the chicken benedict our friend's food was out already. 

The water tasted very funky for a highly raved restaurant so we asked for lemon slices and the lemon slices they gave us had oil all over them...? (at this point I'm thinking this lady hates us)

In short:
Proportions are huge, as said in other reviews.
- I would share dishes if you really want to come here.
Food is interesting & different take on breakfast

Truffle lobster mac n cheese ($16.50 - creamy tallegio-marscapone sauce w\/ Maine lobster and black truffle) was a fail. Two bartenders told us is was their fave dish on the menu. Unfortunately, the joy only lasted for two bites. It tasted like a good mac n cheese that got drowned in truffle oil before it was sent out. That first bite is so rich and then you get that thick oil aftertaste. Boo. We left half of it there and I refuse to have anything with truffle oil for the next month {---- not true

Nom Nom Burger ($16.50 - Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chips, 1000 island) is a hard item to review. On one hand, the beef was realllllly good. Flavorful, moist, cooked to a perfect medium. On the other hand, the toppings added 0. My theory is they need to triple what they put on top the burger. When you serve a thick burger you need equally thick toppings, otherwise you get one bite toppings and then three bites beef....repeat. Conceptually awesome, it failed to execute.

Drinks:
Ginger Julie ($13 - muddled mint & lemon, canadian whiskey, ginger ale) had no bite.
 
Rhubarb Pie Bam-Boozled Shake ($11 - Absolut hibiscus, rhubarb compote, cornmeal crumble) was delicious...but again, lacked any bite. Should you be getting drunk off of milkshakes? Probably not, but it's a hella good way to go out, no?!

Our meal started with miso soup, chawanmushi, and namasu.  The small sashimi plate came with almost 30 pieces of assorted fish.  I'm from Hawaii, so I eat a lot of raw fish, but there were a few fishes I don't usually eat as sashimi (halibut, halibut fin, butterfish, etc.).  All the fish was really fresh, and the pieces were pretty big.  The sashimi plate also comes with some side dishes that we were unaware of -- we were surprised when they brought us saba, a corn and cheese dish, and grilled mushrooms.  I was so full by the time the chicken\/tempura dinner came.  It was so much food, I couldn't eat anymore.  Hubby thought the chicken was overcooked and a little dry.  He said the tempura was okay.

There's lots of machines to work on, many rooms classes to sign up for if you're interested. There's also a women's weight room to go in which makes me more comfortable, and there's not a lot of people in there. However, it can get quite busy during after work hours which makes sense. They keep the change rooms nice and clean which is a huge plus for me as I am very particular about the change rooms. They just ran out of paper towels, and the people said I had to wait the next day to get them. Really... 

Although, its a lovely gym, the only reason why I'm giving it two stars is because of the customer service. I was on my friend's VIP list, and as a VIP guest you're allowed a two week complimentary pass. Now, this is not this gym's fault particularly but apparently it's like that with L.A. Fitness but apparently the two week pass was changed to one week. I checked with the L.A. Fitness in Woodbine and it was the same thing. The website clearly states as a guest you're allowed a two week complimentary pass, but then they changed it to one week because of the timing and the promotion. My problem is, if it's one week - at least change it on the website so other people know! Since I was already there, I just took the one week pass anyways but I felt there was a bit of unnecessary hassle for it because of the salesperson. 

Besides the point, I felt very uncomfortable because the salesman was obviously trying to get me to buy some kind of pass from the gym probably for commission reason. He kept wanting to sit down and chat with me about my plans for using the gym but how can I tell somebody my plans especially if I haven't tried the gym out before, and I don't see a reason why I have to tell you what my plans are in particular. Eventually, I gave them my e-mail address so they could e-mail me the pass. I probably won't be returning for a while as I'm not the type who works out consistently.",3,0,0

My finance and I took the bus  ($5 each for 24hours) for some non-tourist shopping, and to Fremont Street. The casino was a bit small, but fun and the cigarette smell was almost non-existent, which is light years beyond most Vegas casinos. We were there for Mother's Day and I had flowers delivered to the hotel as a surprise, however, the bell service could not find the flowers and stated they had not received any flowers even though I had proof that someone at the hotel signed for them. 45 minutes later the flowers were ""found"" but the surprise was ruined by having to call the florist and having to go back and forth with the hotel for a half hour.

Service was good, and people checked on us regularly and refilled our waters. The menu wasn't huge, and I decided to pick one of their specialty dishes, lobster pho.

The pho comes with a whole lobster, and a decent amount of meat. While the dish was tasty overall, I was actually expecting the broth to be richer, considering that it was cooked with an entire lobster. 

The menu did say market price, and I knew lobster wouldn't be cheap, but the bowl of lobster pho ended up costing $49, and after tax and tip, I spent $61 on my meal. Not really worth it in my opinion. I could have bought an entire fresh lobster and made my own pho for under $30.

When I saw the gigantic plate coming from the kitchen I knew right away I couldn't finish it. For the price, the portion size alone is a value!

I did also order Wedding soup. Something I never even heard of before moving to Pittsburgh, The soup itself was very delicious. Not bland and with few meatballs (which is FINE with me!). At least I didn't have to ask for the Parmesan cheese, the server brought it out with the soup.

My meal itself was just okay. The bread was kind of tough and hard to cut. The beef didn't have much flavor, but the gravy helped this. The fries, sadly, tasted like the oil they were cooked in needed changed badly. At first I though maybe it was just that there was still skin left on the potatoes, but Darren pointed out the oil problem.

Another comment, WHAT IS WITH THIS AREA AND CURT SERVERS??? If you aren't from Pittsburgh I think you'll be shocked at the rudeness.

With a few minor tweaks, I think it would be a great one.  The fresh seafood selection on the menu left a lot to be desired.  Fresh fish and seafood can be flown in on Fridays for a great week-end menu.

We started off with an appetizer of calamari. When it came I thought we had gotten someone's cheese sticks instead!! I have never seen calamari in stick form before. I am use to O shaped and the tentacles. When we questioned this, our waiter informed us this was a California thing and slicing the calamari in sticks makes it tender and never tough. I didn't think it tasted like calamari.

It seems the restaurant focus is on their ""steamed"" pots. I requested the light saffron cream sauce for my seafood pasta. It was tasty but way too much sauce. If they had added maybe 2 more servings of pasta it might have been ok. A little bit of sauce with seafood goes along way. The sauce should enhance the seafood NOT cover it up!!

My husband had the king crab legs, broccolini, and fries with sea salt. First the crab: the drawn butter (kudos for using unsalted) was served in a small non warming dish. Anyone who has eaten steamed crab legs know they cool off fast!! Using a warming dish to keep the butter warm helps to warm the crab up also!!! 

Having an up charge for side dishes is on the bold side. Especially, if you pay $4 for an order of frozen french fries!! If you have a FRESH seafood restaurant, shouldn't the rest of your food be fresh!!!

With the prices they charge the food should be spot on!!

We asked our waiter about the owner's and found they are from the mid-west and the chef is from Minnesota and knows a lot about seafood (I found that funny)",6,0,0

The service was phenomenal. Our bartender was very friendly and attentive. There was live music going on. The guy was doing a blend of Blues and Soul. We were originally right next to the performer but it was a little too loud so we had to move. It was a great vibe though and something you don't typically hear out at bars. 

Wing night was going on and they were on special for 55 cents a piece. Delicious. Beers seemed a tad pricey. 3.25 for a Bud Light bottle and a friend was drinking tall Stone IPAs at 8.75 a piece.

This being said, I arrived at Harricana ar 18h50, well in advance of meeting a friend at 19h15. By the time he showed up, slightly late, I was tired of the chaotic din, and I still did not have a beer in hand. In fact, between my sitting down and our skipping out, over 1\/2 hour had gone by, with slow service and NO potables. Rather inordinate for a bar.

To the personnel's credit, they did seem extremely busy (place as full), and the hostess had a sense of humor.

I thought about what struck me as odd, and may finally have put a finger on the crucial factor: Harricana attemps to be a ""wine bar"" or a beer theater, if you will. This means waiters in white shirts and aprons, stem glasses (best used for wine), and a crowd not apparently intent on really having a beer. The whole is pretty, but inefficient and ineffective. so they might reconsider and reposition themselves as an actual wine bar, which might better fit the crowd.

We elected to drive down to Vice&Versa where the crowd may have been less upwardly mobile, but the noise level was toned down, a little live jazz eventually started, the food was good, and the pints DID arrive, with a good selection and timely, sympathetic service.",1,0,1

to start, we ordered a Lobster Bisque ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mMm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($48) with a side of Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--Blue Cheese covered Bone-in Filet with Bacon ($55) with a side of Sauted Garlic Mushrooms ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was FABULOUS! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.",2,0,0

It's nice to see...too often I see servers and bartenders getting annoyed with tourists over their questions. Not the case here.

 On average you'll spend around $40 bucks for a top and $40-$70 for a bottom. Sign up for Diva Style and you'll get 5% off once you reach Diva Status, which helps a little. Clearance goes on 50% off sale about every other month, and they have sales in between.

If you're on a budget, try Fashion Bug or Rainbow. If not, Torrid can be a great choice.",3,4,2

Our room, the house and gardens were immaculately well-kept. Owners Luc and Michael have clearly put a lot of love and attention into their haven and they've thought of everything, down to the cedar wardrobe in our room (built specially for the hotel, according to Luc) and the quail eggs fresh from the farm at the breakfast table. The breakfast was nicely substantial as breakfasts go in Montreal (coffee, tea and juice; croissants, several breads and home-baked muffins, fresh cut melon, yogurt, cold cereal and freshly hard-boiled eggs) and in warm weather one can take their food or drinks out into the gardens. We also appreciated that there was laundry, a gym, and a small kitchenette incl a house fridge for guest's use and the clothing-optional hot tub and rooftop deck were a lot of fun. The location was excellent; very easy walk to the metro, to the waterfront, the Village and to Old Montreal. Though this B&B is advertised as 'gay friendly', we would call it 'adult friendly'; we noticed that everyone was very warmly welcomed. We were able to chat with Luc before our departure and found him to be wonderfully personable, as was Jonathan, the assistant who seemed to be everywhere at once and very capably handling all the fine details. We'd wondered if there would be any language barriers and we needn't have worried; their English was perfectly good and was a lot better than our French. We also very much appreciated that Michael reached out to us via email to check on when to expect our arrival and to answer any questions; we felt well-taken care of even before we got there.

We had a completely fabulous time and look forward to coming back.",0,0,0

Service was impeccable, we were greeted by the owner, who thanked us for coming to his restaurant, and the food was delicious and well presented. 

The reason to come here is obviously for the rotating 360 degree view of Las Vegas.  The prices are very high end, but you are paying more for the atmosphere and less for the actual food itself (although it was really delicious and cooked to our liking).  There is also a second level lounge and live music (not sure if they do that every night or just on weekends). 

We were wearing our wedding dress and suit and clearly enjoying a fabulous wedding dinner. the staff was super friendly and complimentary, although i kind of thought they might throw us a freebie, but who am i kidding, nothing is free in Vegas!  Beware of the really nice photographer lady, if you are swept away by the ambiance, you might get sucked into buying one of her photos, which will be one million dollars.  

The elevator staff was very knowledgeable, and without their guidance i would have never been able to navigate the place. they also have a bit of trivia and facts for you.  fun!

656LIWmSMdy5p8GXT_tiIw,x6hKmvInDfuVF_psEQ-Yww,hAMB5-aCxrlqzF5u6NEhkQ,4,2013-08-19,"Been going here for the past 3 years. If you're wondering why I've been here so long, well, mind your own business. This is a review about the school, not me :-) Actually, the only reason I point that out is so you know that I know the school pretty well. 

So much has changed over the past few years and I do think that things are improving. They have the testing, advisement, financial aid, and admissions all in one building and things are so much more organized than when I first went here. 

If you're in need of quiet study time, go to the library. Nice place to study with cool air conditioning. Need access to a computer? Go down to the computer commons. Computers are free to use and there is no time limit. SOMETIMES they will have to ask you to give up your computer to someone who needs to study if they see your not doing anything but this seems to happen more often during the last few weeks of each semester for finals. Printing will cost you 10 cents each.

Some professors are better than others. Work hard, and ask around for who is the best. I have only had 1 negative experience with an English teacher. I don't want to put him on blast here so go to a certain well known site that rates professors and look around. But with that said, be a good judge of character yourself.

I have mixed feelings about the cafeteria. Everything is overpriced. $1.99 for a Powerade you can get for $.50 at Food City or Walmart. My advice is to buy drinks from the Circle K that is right near the school.  I wish they would bring back the croissants during the morning breakfast time. The breakfast burritos they have now are okay but quite bland. Also costly- $3.00 each!!! During lunch and breakfast you can order different foods to be made to order. I personally think the burgers and fries during lunch time are pretty good. They have a nice variety of pizza and Asian cuisine and have healthy foods available. For a full meal, you'll probably end up spending $6-9. Go to Quick Trip and buy a foundation drink, hot dog, and chips for under $4 if you want to stay frugal. Or better than anything, bring your lunch. They have microwaves for anyone to use.

I would either call your professors in advance or wait until you attend class to buy your books. It may seem like the wrong thing to do but sometimes it can save you money. My sister rented a book for math only to find out that the teacher requires the new edition with an online access code course. Waste of money.

Overall a good school, methinks.",2,1,0

The fries were dry and barely warm. I requested gravy but they said they didn't offer it except for with poutine?!?!  But I don't really eat dairy so I just wanted gravy and would pay extra.. Nope they refused to sell me gravy. 

I only had a few bites as the fries were dry and then when I got home (TMI sorry) I rushed to the bathroom. I guess my system rejected this crap.

Salad was fresh and tasty, not one element wilted or bad. If they'd bring back raspberry vinaigrette, I'd give them 5-1\/2 stars.

Since this was my first time here, I worried it would be more of a bar than a pub. This *is* Vegas, and alcohol abuse is an issue (the reason I avoid bars here). Despite their amply stocked bar, they seem to have strict rules, so the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxed.

We were looking for another flooring company that was gone so we wandered into Nulook Floors and were surprised to find such a wide selection of flooring choices and, of course, the perfect floor that we had been searching for . . . no one else has it.  Apollo was so kind & helpful and answered every question for our first floor replacement project.  We had all the carpets removed from our 3 bedrooms and 3 closets and replaced it with a beautiful rustic graphite grey flooring which looks incredible.  We also replaced our funky 2"" standard floor moulding with a gorgeous 4"" moulding throughout the entire house which gives each room more height.  The entire job was completed in under 2 days and the Ramirez Installation team were professional, courteous, meticulous & clean . . . they did an amazing job!
We are so very happy and would definitely recommend Nulook Floors to anyone looking for a new & stunning floor.  Thank you Apollo & Joseph & the Ramirez Installation team for the terrific experience and for making our home look so new again!!",0,0,0

We split the spring rolls which were clearly premade since the rice paper wrap was a bit chewy from sitting around. They were nothing like the picture in the menu. Reminds me of McDonald's menu pictures. 

I tried the pho broth and it was just ok. His pho came out in less than 2 minutes, that along with the spring rolls. Out waters came out after...... if that tells you something.

I tried the bun bo hue broth and it tasted exactly the same as the pho. I about got up and left and probably would have if I was by my self. They give you a side of the seasoning to add to the broth which is just plain lazy. If they don't know how to make one of Vietnam's traditional soups then just leave it off the menu instead of embarrassing yourself.

Only reason I came here was because it was a 24hr joint. If you want good Vietnamese food go to pho khan do down the street during regular hours.",0,0,0

the pool area was nice, but beware of the chemicals. the hot tub wasn't bubbling but we popped in it. the chemical smells again were nasty. you could feel it on your skin. we didn't stay in it. after cleaning ourselves off we were driving home the next day and we still smelled the chemicals on our skin. it ruined my new swimsuit. it still smells like chemicals after 3 washings (one in vinegar to try to rid of the smell). it took a couple days for our skin to return to normal. that is just not healthy. we paid $40 for 'resort fees' for our stay to have that happen?
staff was nice. i asked for a blanket one evening (none on the bed) and was told they don't have any. never got one the whole time i was there. luckily had a comforter in the car i dragged up into the room.

I wanted a clip in hair piece with bangs so that I could change up my look on occasion. The girl who helped me, Lisa, took her time finding different pieces and shades to match my hair and did seem knowledgable in that process. However, when she clipped the piece on my head and began to cut the bangs to the length I wanted, SHE CUT MY ACTUAL HAIR in the process! *Let me point out NOT to a traditional bang length either (they're about 2 inches long) and it looks like my 4-year old got ahold of the scissors when I was asleep and tried to give me a haircut!* When she took the piece off I immediately pointed out what happened and she said, ""I'm so sorry"". Meanwhile I'm in tears and she said she had to talk to her manager. She came back and said she could offer me the piece for half off (it was $120) and I said ""half off? you should be GIVING me this piece for what you did and now I have (way too short!) bangs that I didn't want!"" She said she would take care of it. I asked her if she would please finish getting the piece ready so I could get out of there.

The next morning I called and spoke with the owner, Kimberly, who was very apologetic and asked if there's anything she could do. Well, not really, unless you can wave a magic wand and grow my hair back. I understand that sometimes accidents happen but this type of mistake is something that now affects my look every single day and is just beyond frustrating! I trusted Lisa that she knew what she was doing and for that I am sorry. I am now having to deal with shorter than bangs pieces on either side of my head. It's a HUGE INCONVENIENCE that is going to take years to grow out to the length of my hair (well below my shoulders).",7,13,1

We liked everything but the tofu three ways. It's just three blocks of cold tofu, with different soy sauces and toppings. We ordered it without the caviar, but neither of us liked the truffle or kimchi one. This could just be us being picky eaters, but I didn't like that we left 95% of it untouched and the waitress didn't ask what was wrong; she just cleared the plate.

A friend suggested pizza, but neither of us were in the mood for the usual.  He searched Yelp and came up with The Parlor and its great reviews.  we decided to give it a shot.

We showed up around 6:30 to a packed parking lot.  There was a long wait for a table inside, but we opted to eat on the patio and were immediately seated (after, of course, a Scottsdale mom and and old dude each cut in front of us).  Our waitress was Lisa.  She brought us water and made drink recommendations.  The drink special of the night was some sort of watermelon\/vodka\/lime juice concoction, which she highly recommended.  I took her up on that while my friend ordered a Blue Moon Hefe (on tap).  My drink was AWESOME!  I expected some sort of syrupy-sweet watermelon-flavored drink, but what I got was real, pureed watermelon!  Really good, really refreshing... and really refreshing at $9!  It was worth it.

After mulling over the menu, we decided to split the spicy BBQ chicken pizza, sans green onions.  We waited a short while before our pizza was brought out.  To my dismay, I noticed green onions all over the pizza.  We flagged down our waitress and asked for a new one.  True to her word, just five minutes later we had a fresh pie.  This pizza was, perhaps, one of the BEST I've ever had.  The crust wasn't too thin or too thick, the BBQ sauce was wonderfully flavorful and just enough, and the serrano chiles were really hot.  The 12"" was a perfect size for the two of us to split.  We weren't overstuffed but weren't left hungry, either.

For dessert, we ordered a seasonal fruit crostata, which that day was nectarine.  It was served with a small scoop of vanilla gelato.  this was a fantastic end to a perfect meal.  The fruit was sweet and tart, the crust was flaky and sweet, and the gelato tied it all together.

Altogether, our bill came out to $49 and change, which I felt was a great value for a meal that included three drinks apiece, pizza, and dessert.  Oh, and the pizza?  We're both still talking about and craving it.  I'm looking forward to my next visit!",4,2,4

We have paid out of pocket, waited for 3 hours. We were not given icepack or some kind of support to keep arm comfortable during the wait. Finally when doctor saw us and took an X-ray, broken bone was confirmed. They tried to wrap my kid's shoulder using a elastic bandage roll. Nurses were really confused how to do it and hurt my kid in the process. They made a huge knot on her back. While we were wondering on the impracticality of this wrap my daughter was crying in pain. Doctor asked nurses to take it off and told us basically we don't need to do anything it will heal by itself. We came out without a sling or support for the arm, just an X-ray and a prescription of child size shoulder support which was not available in any pharmacy in Las Vegas. They didn't give us any useful information about where to buy it. They just took our money and sent us back in the same shape we came in. Only more hurt because of botched attempt on making a makeshift clavicle wrap. If anything they should make a makeshift sling. I learned that when I called my doctor next day. When I put a sling on my 6 years old next day she felt immediately comfortable and remarked, 'Why did doctor not think of it?'. This doctor didn't even mention sling. I can't believe we spent a whole day without sling probably making it worse. We carried her in and carried her out as it hurt with every step.

To my last show in 2012 to listen to a couple of guys whom played piano and told a story of their lifestyle and upbringing whilst learning to play an instrument from an early age...to the recent play ""Translations"".

Set in an Irish school, in 1833, it sets the scene the British Army tasked to translate place names from ancient Irish Gaelic to the King's English.

Owen, brother teacher Manus, returns after period in Dublin, acting as translator and go-between for the British and Irish, a love triangle between Yolland, Manus, and a local woman, Mire, complicates things?

Directed by acclaimed actor and director, Adrian Dunbar. Translations was the first production by Field Day Theatre Company founded by Tony Award Winner Friel and Stephen Rea, is creatively produced play from one of the greatest living English-language dramatists. 

Quite frankly sitting in an art deco styled theatre such as the refurb'd Kings, you could be forgiven for thinking you were in London's Soho\/theatre district; both places should be twinned and adorned by Luvvies alike for sheer exuberance.

Edina is so lucky to have a real theatre that had it's ups and downs over the years, and lucky me for getting a chance to see this one...recommended to all who like a good ""Mnage  trois"", a few laughs and possibly tears!  

Even nowadays people daily don't dress like they do in this play anymore, but if you like period costume and have a hunger to see, these cossys, but not in a museum then you may have missed your chance, for now!

Once a year, since it's close and convenient I go here to do my smog check on the way to the dmv to renew registration. Usually the service is quick and efficient.... 

.....ahhh but on this day.... it was one FAIL after the other. First off, I pull up the truck to the right-most port where the smog machine is set-up. A guy in uniform walks RIGHT by me and proceeds to chat up the cute girl in the minivan behind me. Sorry for him, because she's my wife...and we're here to smog two cars. I noticed the name on the shirt was Shaun and made mental note to myself to consider a chat with the manager. 

Knowing the drill, I get out of the car and wait for a technician. No one comes. We go inside the small waiting room (keys in hand) and go right up to the counter where Shaun is dutifully doing something on the computer. Not one word of acknowledgement. not one hint of interest in the customer. focus shaun! focus! i look over at their feeble attempted install of a privacy filter and find out that our friend shaun is watching the countdown on a bid he has on ebay. still standing right there in front of him, he backs away and walks out. still without a word.  

I start looking around to see if there are any numbers on the wall for customer service and much to my dismay i see the plaque on the wall that says: Shaun Cavanaugh, Manager. tisk tisk. this is gonna be called up to corporate. 

Another customer walks in and sits down to wait for his vehicle getting an oil change. I notice it's a Honda Element...and THEN I notice them filling it up with Valvoline 5W-20. Seriously? It's nearly 120 degrees outside and these guys are willfully filling up customer cars with 5W-20? For anyone who doesn't know oil, take heed and just know that in this kind of weather, 30 should be minimum!!!

Our server kind of also convinced all of us to get mimosas. Too bad they don't offer bottomless mimosas....I'm taking a star off because the mimosa was actually really horrible. It was probably the worst mimosa I've ever had. Not sure if I'll be coming back again, but if I do, I'll probably be back more sober.",3,1,0

My last visit was not pleasant at all. A couple of weeks ago I followed up on my test results and I spoke to someone at front desk. She had disclosed that I was tested positive for something and was going to fax the prescription to my pharmacy after 2hrs. She even verified my full name and the day that I came in for the test. 

A few hours later I called my pharmacy to see whether they had received a fax from this clinic and I was told they haven't. I called my pharmacy the following morning and again they told me that they did not receive anything. The following day I sent the clinic a fax to disclose my conversation with the receptionist and also gave the pharmacy's fax number again. 

It's been two weeks since I've heard anything from the clinic. Yesterday i decided to drop in myself to figure out what was happening and I was getting worried. 

During my visit, the doctor told me that my test results were clear and there wasn't anything wrong with me. However I told him multiple times that someone at front desk confirmed with me that I was tested positive for (cannot publicly disclose). I was furious and not impressed with the lack of professionalism someone at front desk had showed me. The fact that she misinformed me is actually a huge concern because she has caused stressed on me and she doesn't know that a small mistake could result into a serious matter. 

I only came here a few times because I work long hours and can't find the time to see my family doctor. But if you can, try to stick to seeing your own doctor because their staff is lacking in professionalism and can risk providing wrong information, which happened in my case. I'm just happy that I saw my own lab results. This time I read it myself so that I could see solid proof that I'm healthy otherwise. Beyond disappointed and still disgusted.",2,0,0

The restaurant has a very sophisticated, lounge-y atmosphere, with tall ceilings, dark but simple decorating and furniture, and soft, unobtrusive music playing.  I was seated in the restaurant side of the space, which also houses the sushi bar.  The other side seemed to be a bar with alcoholic drinks served.  It was a good fit for my mood today; sometimes I like to eat in a local, bento-box sized restaurant with faux fusuma, but today I needed some elbow room, and this fit the bill.  

I started out my meal with my appetizer staple, Miso soup.  It was pricier than most places at $4 (I usually pay $2, even at restaurants where the rolls are more expensive than they were here).  It was a good sized portion and tasted fresh.  The tofu was also just the right consistency - not too soggy, and not crunchy in the middle like it came from some box like a crouton.  

I ordered a very American roll this time, Philadelphia.  I was pretty impressed!  Everything tasted extremely fresh, and the entire roll stayed together when I soaked it in soy sauce before taking a bite.  The pickled ginger that accompanied was also very crisp and fresh tasting, not slimy and over-pickled like it can become at some places.  

The service was prompt, and my server was very friendly, helpful, and attentive (but not too much).  I tipped him generously, as I had appreciated both the service and the break it had provided me in the day when I needed it.

The restaurant was just over half full, so we can't blame the bad service on a busy night. All in all it was very disappointing. We have been going to Lopez since it was at its old location ""Lopez y Gonzoles"" The service has gotten progressively worse. Don't know if we'll go again. Kind of sad.",1,1,0

Usually I hate going to ramen restaurants due to the long lineup and the food not living up to the hype, but Koi is definitely a ramen restaurant that I will for sure to revisit and recommend. 

Environment:
The plaza is pretty easy to find and get to if you drive a car. But then again, it is super inconvenient to get anywhere if you don't own a car in Markham\/Richmond Hill. There are plenty of parking at the plaza, however, it seems that there are more cars now due to the new hot pot place that recently opened, but there are still loads of parking space at the back. 
The restaurant itself is pretty small though, best for a casual dine-out for groups of 4 and under. 

Food:
Since this is a ramen restaurant it's no brainer that you must try their ramen dishes. Me and my friend both decided to order the Hokkaido Ramen (about $10) plus a Deep Fried Pork Cutlet (about $5) on the side, just in case there wasn't enough toppings in the ramen. The ramen ended up being really filling though, and for the toppings there was 1 egg, 2 slices of bbq pork, 1 small slice of fish ball, some corn, black fungus, green onion, and a strip of seaweed in the bowl. The soup was really nice and creamy, and it was relieving to see that there was no MSG in it since I didn't get super thirsty after the meal. The Pork Cutlet wasn't that good in my opinion and the batter is a little too thick. If you feel that you won't be full from the ramen you should just add extra pork to the noodle as opposed to order side dishes.  
They also have tofu cheesecake for $4 a slice, but I was already too full after my meal to give it a try. The alcohol menu was pretty large as well and they have some other interesting Japanese beverages.

Service:
The service was actually pretty good. Our waitress was really friendly and attentive and she would come by on occasion to ask how the food is and to refill our tea.",0,0,0

First, we made a reservation and showed about 15 minutes early.  Even though there were plenty of empty tables, we were told that our table would not be ready and that we could go to the bar and have some drinks until it was.  OK, we did just that.  Just after ordering our drinks at the bar the hostess came to us and said that our table was now ready.  Not having our beverages in hand we thought it prudent to wait for the beverages (half price at the bar) but hostess said that we would then have to forfeit our table.

My favorite part! Dessert. It was my birthday, so I had all 4 desserts (I don't recall if this was a birthday only thing or what they do for everything).

Flan | Walnuts | Berries | Cognac Caramel Sauce - Tasty, but a bit too sweet. Not enough balance here for me. 3\/5 

Chocolate Sacher-Torte | Chocolate Cake Ice Cream | Chocolate Decor | Port Soaked Cherries. Tasty, but the tort was a lot to take in after a 3 hour eating session. 3\/5

Kiwi | Honeycomb | House-Made Ricotta | Bee Pollen - This was my favorite dessert. Just the right amount of sweetness to go along with the savoryness. 5\/5

Root Beer Bundino | Ginger Pastry Cream | Ginger Beer - I had requested a palate cleanser after the kangaroo, and this was what they brought me. It did the job! 4\/5

Strawberry | Oats | Rhubarb | Shortcake | Strawberry Ice Cream | Rhubarb Sauce - Again, another great balance here. Not too sweet, not too savory, just the right mix. 5\/5

To end off the night I got a frozen lemon curd lollipop, which was quite interesting. I've never had anything like it, but it was a great way to end the meal 4.5\/5

Onto my least favorite part of the meal... the bill. You obviously see the $$$$. You are going to be paying for this meal.

This is another Kato Cajun restaurant in disguise or vice versa. I forgot to mention somehow Kato Cajun uses the same carry out box... I wonder if this is owned by the same owner. Yes this is a lot busier than Kato just around the corner. Yes they have a cheaper 1 entree meal at 5.95 for chicken teriyaki. An employee was standing in front enticing you with samples. The food really taste the same, but you get less sauce and less portion here. The meal comes with white rice and for another 50 cents you can upgrade to fried rice or brown rice. You get a side of vegetables which is chopped up cabbage. It also appears that they reheat the food on the hot plate after you order so it is somewhat fresher than the other stands. To me it taste a little less salty than Kato but really has the same taste. Overall you will leave full, but you can definitely do better.

Pros: free sample, daily 5.95 chicken teriyaki meal with white rice and vegetables

Cons: bland and still salty

This is a very small restaurant offers lots of craft beers, a very good wine list, gourmet pizzas and salads. 

They use mostly local ingredients, they bake their own bread, pull their own cheese and the chef controls the minerals in the water for the correct taste. The staff is the most friendly staff I ever came across anywhere and every single person was engaging with us.

We started with a lovely sounding kale and pear salad to share. When it arrived it looked sort of pretty but at the time I couldn't remember all the ingredients it was suppose to have in it. I just thought I read the menu wrong at the time.

It turned out to be missing not one, not Two, BUT THREE ingredients at least. (not sure if I actually got the creamy pumpkin dressing?)

That means-

#1- the prep person preparing the salad might not have been trained in what goes into it. 

#2- the server wasn't trained in what he was serving and wasn't aware the salad was incomplete.

I thought one of the two pizzas was very good and it was the pizza with the fig sauce, three cheeses and arugula. No complaints with that pizza the Fico was very good. 

I'm not sure if the Blanco was made right, seemed like something was missing.

This cafeteria style eatery is bright and cheery and immaculate. The interior graphics certainly lend to the unique flavor of the place and full view of the clean and well lit kitchen assure you that this place values their equipment and the product they turn out. Two things I liked about the menu right away were the variety of wing flavors and the reasonably priced wing amounts you are able to order. You can get anywhere from a ten piece order on up to orders for huge party. Plus, they had no problem splitting the ten piece wing order we had into 2 different flavors. 

They don't only sell wings either. I had some of the best fried catfish I've had in years and the portions are huge. The catfish came with fires and cole slaw and these side orders were excellent as well. Plus I had some fried okra and it was done very well. I could taste the okra and there was a slight spicy flavor but the breading wan't overpowering and the okra wasn't soggy. Back to the catfish... it was flaky and delicious, again not rubbery or overdone. I suspect they use fresh catfish and bread the orders as they come in and don't use frozen prefab stuff. It was great!

The gal at the desk taking orders was extremely friendly and helpful and advised on the order so we could get what we wanted and made suggestions. The place had steady business and there were a lot of phone in orders coming in and being picked up but she was smooth sailing all the way. This is a family business and you can tell they are proud of what they do and the food they offer. 

For a ten piece order of wings, a side of fries, a 2 piece catfish meal with fries and coleslaw and a side of fried okra plus a soda it was 23 bucks. That's more than reasonable for the amount of food and the QUALITY of food we received. I'll be back for sure!",2,0,1

Gesamt Eindruck ist so im groen und ganzen ok.
die Terrasse ist nett und luftig. 
Die neue Innenausstattung ist sehr gelungen.
Die Kellner sehr ordentlich disziplinierte Erscheinung wie man es von Italienern kennt aber leider auch so ein wenig das Gefhl von ich kenn dich nicht du musst es dir verdienen hier Stammgast sein zu drfen so ne art von Tz tzz tzzzhh sei froh das du hier sein darfst.. Ohne rassistisch sein zu wollen bin selber Spanier aber in italienischen Restaurants ist es echt oft so als sei man als Gast nicht gut genug wenn man nicht jede Woche da ist und sich nicht schon seit zehn Jahren kennt. Leider ist dieses typische Verhaltensmuster das auf meiner subjektiveren Wahrnehmung basiert auch hier der fall. Schade scheint wohl in der Italienischen Gastfreundschaft fest verankert zu sein, dass man solange man nichts sagt und immer alles toll findet auch ein wrdiger Gast ist fr den Wirt und so sich eine Beziehung entwickelt.Fr mich ist das ein geben und nehmen und das passt meistens bei dieser Kultur nicht.
Ich habe ein Lieblings deutschen, einen Lieblings Inder, Lieblings Chinesen und Lieblings Franzosen aber einen Lieblings Italiener habe ich bis heute nicht gefunden und das wo die italienische Kche einer der tollsten, innovativsten,gesundesten und geschmackvollsten Kchen der Welt ist. warum nur seit ihr so unnahbar was Kritik angeht.Ihr habt in Europa die tollsten traditionellsten Produkte aber muss man denn so berheblich sein und den qualitativen Wert eurer Produkte mit so einem emotionalen verhalten herabstrzen. Schade.Das letzte mal als ich da war hab ich bersehen das auf meiner Pizza keine Tomatensoe dazu gehrt und habe hald gefragt und ich bekam so eine Antwort die mir das Gefhl gab das ich dumm bin und und nicht richtig lesen kann und selbst Schuld bin. Ja mag sein bin in dem fall selbst Schuld aber man htte zumindest mal fragen knnen ob man was organisieren soll.Nein statt dessen sa ich da und hab in eine Pizza beien mssen die trocken war und nicht das war was ich mir vorgestellt hatte. Dumm gelaufen fr mich.Deswegen lass ich meinem rger diesmal auf diesem weg freien Lauf und gebe euch schweren Herzens drei Sterne obwohl ihr was mein letzten besuch angeht nur eins verdient httet.Ich bin ein ehrlicher und fairer Mensch ich wrde euch so gerne mehr Punkte geben aber das liegt nicht in meiner Hand.
Ihr seit ein so gutes Restaurant bitte werdet nicht so wie die anderen. Bleibt offen und kocht weiterhin so toll wie man das von euch kennt.Ihr msst Gas geben und eure Gste respektieren und ihre Anregungen ernst nehmen damit sich Vertrauen entwickelt und der Erfolg grer wird und Ihr Respekt und Anerkennung bekommt fr eure Leistung.

Firstly, their staff are superb- very knowledgeable about their food and bursting with enthusiasm as soon as you enter the door. I had the rice noodles with edamame, corn and coconut curry  tofu. The noodles were the perfect consistency -not soggy nor too stiff. The toppings were also generously piled on top and very flavourful (the tofu was a little dry, but still tasty). There are 4 sauces to choose from and you can choose more than one - lIsten to them when they tell you that their Penang curry is SPICY! I brushed it off when the server told me that it's dang spicy and next thing I know I was tearing up and fanning myself profusely. I even mixed it with a little bit of the sweet chili lime sauce!!! But despite the sweat and tears, it was very tasty. I just caution the ones who aren't big fans of spicy food. 

The thing I love about Basil Box is that they have a great vegan friendly selection. Aside from the animal protein options, everything else on their menu is vegan and labelled as so! It's really amazing to see many more restaurants aware of the vegan movement. 

The thing I don't like about Basil Box is that it is not suitable for those with peanut allergies. The  classic peanut curry is right next to the other sauces and the chopped peanuts are next to their other garnishes and it is very easy for their to be some cross contamination.They could place their peanut products together, away from the other inserts, making it a little more safe for people with peanut allergies to eat here. Just something to keep in mind.

Over all, the Basil Box was a good first experience. I paid about $10 for my box and I'd say the portion was reasonable for the price. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a quick, healthy bite ;)",5,0,5

The only good customer service I got was from one bartender named Jaime he is the best. If you come here it's a waist of money. When I asked for a manager I was never given a real manager to talk to. I heard Dreas is better. Next time I'll go there. Also they have the edges of the whole dance floor filled with empty tables for supposedly VIP. So you really can't get a rail to lean on and look over to the beautiful view down below. It is really more like a waste of space bc nobody sits there and if you leave your bag on one of the couches they make a big deal about it. It kills the rooftop experience of the club. Overall the only good thing I got from it was an awesome zipline ride and good views because other than that it's mostly older men and women in their 50s 60s maybe not really a party crowd and the music was ok. I would rather gamble my money away than waste it here. Would not recommend or come back unless they change their customer service skills.,1,0,0

My friend wanted a mixed drink, and the waitresses who were trying to also cover the bar had no idea what they were doing and needed to be instructed on how to make a gin and tonic.  Also worthy of note, their liquor display - you know, the cool wall of bottles that all bars have - is a sad display of just 5 bottles.  Onto the food.  The edamame was fine, but only lightly salted and a very small portion.  The spicy tuna roll was very good, but the Scottsdale roll lacked the precision I expect from a sushi chef.

We ordered the Sunday Special (eggs benedict with salmon and avocado), as well as the banana pancakes. The eggs benny were nothing to write home about; the salmon could've been fresher and hollandaise sauce was too salty. And while the salad on the side added some colour, it did nothing more than fill the plate.

Even more disappointing were the banana pancakes. While huge and fluffy, each pancake only contained about three slices of bananas. I make better (albeit not as fluffy) ones myself.

Nonetheless, the subject never ceases to amaze me.  Which is why when BODIES... The Exhibition made its way to Silicon Valley, I was looking forward to perusing a variety of polymer-preserved body parts whilst recalling the materials from the Human Anatomy class that I took during my freshman year.

Allow two hours to go through the various sections (no pun intended) of the exhibition: skeletal, muscular, respiratory, circulatory, and nervous system.  Allow extra time in the circulatory system section - see what you would have looked like you are stripped off everything else but your heart, veins and arteries.  Look at what a blackened pair of lungs look like and wish that you had stuck to that new year's resolution of yours.  Touch the parts that they have so kindly taken out for the benefit of the visitors (it was a heart and a liver - it feels almost like made-in-china plastic toys *inside joke for those of you who got it*).

We came here because of a Groupon for 2. I made a reservation, and upon checking in to the restaurant, my party and I were seated within a few minutes. 

Salad\/side bar is decent, though I'd recommend staying away from the rice and mashed potatoes trying to steal stomach space from the steaks and meats. 

Meats includes tri tip roast, pork loin, pork tenderloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken breast, salmon, smoked ham, mussels, shrimp, grilled pineapple, and grilled chicken thighs. Our favorites were definitely the pork dishes, all seasoned and cooked very well. The beef and chicken dishes fell a bit flat: beef tended to be under seasoned, chicken was dry. Aside from the mussels that were extremely overcooked, the seafood was very good. The one annoying thing was the frequency of the dishes offered to us. We probably were offered smoked ham 4 times, whereas the lamb only came around once, and portions were tiny (though the lamb was also an underseasoned, overcooked disappointment).

Organization: Terrible. The booths were not well-spaced so people were basically everywhere.  It was very difficult to read menus and see what each stall had to offer.

Selection: Reasonable. There was a variety of mac and cheese, several beer vendors, some free sampling, etc.

Prices: I'm still baffled...  15 tickets cost $10 and additional tickets were 10 for $10.  Can someone explain how that makes any sense?  Did I read the sign wrong?  Anyways, some places charged very little for their menu items, while others were charging way too much.  

Lines: Horrendous. People were in lines that snaked around all over the place.  I'd say the average wait time would be at least 30 minutes if not more.

Cooked when order using local naturally raise beef.

Although she did at least turn it from the weather to the game for us. We changed our order from dine in to 'to go' and left. The pizza had a wonderful amount of toppings but didn't appear to be the thin crust that we had ordered and we asked for the wings to be half medium and half hot but although they were boxed separately they seem to be the same. We should have asked for a manager when we were told 'no' but we just decided to write a sad review instead. The restaurant was empty, by the way. Except for people picking up orders to go. I wonder why people don't stay?",1,0,0

NqTb1RfkMF8PxYeRoWHscQ,lvDoRPz9Uj_4eEpglTe96w,ByFMv3p5X1aNeZhU61rDcA,3,2016-04-17,"The Stratosphere has got to be one of the best values in Vegas. On the real. I booked a trip through Expedia, and my round trip cost for three nights and airfare was approximately $270 a person. Seriously, you can't beat that.

It's true, the Strat is on the far end of the Strip and quite the walk to all the true draws of Vegas. But, it has a great many benefits that I think make it a worthwhile hotel stay - not just including the price. The rooms are fairly basic, which might be a drawback to some, but I think it's to be expected considering its cost. Everything was clean, well maintained, and up to snuff. Really, if you're coming to Vegas to spend all your time in the room and you need frills and opulence, you've got different priorities than me. 

While it's true that it is not in the best looking part of town, I never felt unsafe or at risk in any way, even while walking my way to the main part of the Strip. Having said that, I wouldn't recommend making that walk because it's a LOT further than you think it is. Get a bus pass. 

Hotel staff were all friendly, courteous, and seemed to know their stuff. They had plenty of recommendations on restaurants, other non-gambling\/show things to do, and were very willing to accommodate any requests I had. They even watched my bags for the majority of the day on which I left as my flight didn't take off until 10pm and checkout was at 11am. For a small fee of $30, I was able to get a late check out of 3pm, but that still left me 7 hours to burn and I didn't want to lug my small backpack around.

The casino is definitely not as large as those further down the Strip, but the table games can be found with LOW minimums. I'm talking $5 blackjack. As someone who is not a huge gambler, I found this to be awesome and a great way to break yourself in. Plenty of slots too and more than enough eating options right in the hotel (although they may not be everyone's bag... I'll try to do separate reviews for those that I visited).

One additional perk of being a guest of the Stratosphere is being able to get to the top of the tower at no additional cost. The rides are definitely not my kind of thing, I don't even do rollercoaster that are on the ground let alone hundreds of feet off the ground on top of a tower, but the views from the observation deck and atop the tower are killer and can't be beat. Even if you're not staying here, I'd say it's worth the trip to get to the top at night and scope out the Strip from above. It might be even better on mind altering substances... not that I would know anything about that or those.

Yes, there are plenty of nicer, more expensive, more recently updated options in Vegas. But the Stratosphere suits me just fine and I had a great time there. For the cost, it can't be beat and I am sure I'll find myself staying here again in the not so distant future.",3,1,2

Things I didn't like:

One, the restaurant is HOT! It was a scorcher of a Sunday and there were 5 people working in the open kitchen with no AC in the place. Well I think I saw an AC unit but it didn't seem to be making a dent in the heat. The place became unbearably stuffy pretty quickly. It doesn't take too long for a customer to eat a burger but I felt bad for the kitchen staff.

Two, my burger was smaller than the bun and that's my biggest burger pet peeve. Give me a smaller bun but don't you dare give me a smaller patty. Also, what's the deal with gristle in my burger? That was really unpleasant.

Things I did like:

Service was really good! The guy at the cash was pleasant and did me a solid by refilling my water bottle even though he was swamped. I really appreciated that on such a hot day. I also like that they bring your meal to you in a slightly informal, yell your name sort of way. I dig it.

Our milkshakes were yummy!

Having already been to Joe Beef and loving it, I was really excited when I managed to snag a table for 2 on a Saturday night at 7 at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.

The service was fantastic and attentive. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable with wines and when we told her what we were going to have she went looking for some great wines to pair. The wines were all between $60-$100 also so all within a reasonable price point (I just can't justify any more than $100 for a bottle of wine).

The food of course did not disappoint either. We started with a very thinly sliced rib eye on toast special which was probably my wife's favourite dish. For mains I decided to go for the beef in Joe Beef and had the steak which came with steak sauce, horseradish and pickle on the side. My wife went for the lobster spaghetti which I also tried and was incredible. The shocker was we ordered some brussel sprouts on the side and these stole the show. Definitely the best brussel sprouts I've ever had with so much incredible flavour.

Overall I have no complaints and would definitely head back to any of the Joe Beef restaurants.",0,0,0

Our dealer said that anytime there is a special occasion, he always treats his mom to brunch here. Also, another guy who actually worked at the Paris told my fianc and I that Yelp rated Mon Ami Gabi one of the top 10 places to dine in Las Vegas. We consider ourselves Las Vegas dining connoisseurs at this point we have a dined at all of the hottest spots, or so we thought. Our last day in Vegas, before we hit the road - we always like to treat ourselves to a good, hearty brunch. The night before, we were hanging out at the Paris & decided to look at the place and make a reservation if we liked the way that it looked. The hostesses said that if we got there around 8 AM, we wouldn't need a reservation and that they don't take reservations for the outdoor seating area anyways. We knew we wanted to sit outside so we got there around 8:15 AM the next day. We were able to walk right in and we got, what I believe to be one of the best tables available. Our server greeted us right away and unfortunately I did not get her name as she wasn't wearing a name tag. She told us about the two specials they had available that day. My fianc and I decided to split the All-American breakfast, add an egg and some avocado. That was more than enough for the two of us. We were originally going to get one All-American breakfast each - but there would be no way either of us could come close to finishing that. The portions are large. Also, the coffee is delicious. Definitely better than your regular diner\/caf coffee. Our server was definitely on it terms of making sure our coffee was constantly filled. We had some ice water to accompany our meal. The ambience is great. We enjoyed going so early, because it was the middle of July in the desert, had we sat outside later I might be too hot or unbearable. I recommend going early for that reason and also to get the best seat. Sitting outside is definitely what you want. Definitely creates the environment that you're in Europe, more specifically Paris.Our server dropped the check right away, maybe she could since we were in a rush or on our way out.

Well I'm  no Donnie......nor Marie for that matter, but what I am is someone from the south that doesn't own a pair of cowboy boots? 

So having recently been invited to Coyote Joes country bar for some line dancing lessons, I decided it was time to get me a nice pair of sh*t kickers....as my Daddy use to call them for this little shindig.

After asking some of my well established Charlotteans, Lebos was the place to go for all things country western and cowboy and they didn't disappoint.

The store is tucked away on Independence Blvd, just away from all the car dealerships that litter that section of Charlotte.  It is a big space with everything from boots to SADDLES?!?!?!  Yes folks, if you ever want to get your kink on by LITERALLY mounting your significant other via a saddle, this is the place to get it........but forgive me.......I digress.

the boot selection is good....but not too extensive.  They have boots as low as $99, but as high as $450, but all are nice looking strudy brands and an average price of around $150.

I was torn between cowboy boots and ropers (if you have to ask, just google it) and the salesman was very helping in walking me through the decision process of why I'd want a rubber soled boot as opposed to a leather soled boot.  In the end I selected the leather sole as it was both $10 cheaper and good for line dancing at Coyote joes....I swear the guy said that and never knew I was going there.

Also found out they carry a superior grade of Carharts which I didn't know exisisted, so I also learned something too.

Great place, good selection, nice folks and reasonable prices.........so if you gotta go country..........go to Lebos!",4,1,2

Main dish ordered was the Tuna (Maguro) absolutely cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth mad good. It had a dark garlic sauce drizzled over. The combination of both & presentation was superior.
Ordered the Whatever Roll, that is very popular and can so see why! (Pic) Ginger Roll was just about my favorite! (See Pic)
California Roll & Spicy Tuna Roll - Great
Complementary dessert at the end of your meal- with a sweetly placed surprise fortune cookie on top.
